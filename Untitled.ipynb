       " 'son:  The crappy ones you can buy in a toy shop?\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Yes! But what I did was I collected the same chemical over and over again from different pharmacies to get enough to make the explosion enormous\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  … And you blew the roof off of your house?\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  well, a hole yes - but my parents were so poor, we lived with a hole in our roof for months\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  what did your parents say?\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  they were both so angry, but my parents had a lot of love for me I think, so it was fine in the end\\n',\n",

       " 'father:  thankfully not, it did get quite cold though at times\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  you know I do think back to those times very fondly however, they were good times. Life was more simple, but maybe that’s just how it is as a kid no?\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  yep, I remember everything being so much easier. Remember when I used to wake up and watch cartoons on a saturday and you used to make pancakes?\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  those were so good!\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  I remember the smell the most, and the feeling of the warm sun coming through the windows\\n',\n",

       " 'father:  it was always important for me to have you grow up around plants\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  really? Why?\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  I’m not entirely sure, maybe because I had that when I was younger? you know it was always a struggle for me to accept that you were growing up in a big city like London, with so much at your disposal, including a middle class family\\n',\n",
       " 'father: like, I had nothing, and you had everything handed to you. I feel as though it was such an integral part of my education to have to fend for myself\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  yes I know, but honestly I feel as though you just assumed I had to learn that stuff at way too young of an age\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  what do you mean?\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  well it’s just I remember when you used to force me to go out and get stuff from the shops when it was dark, or getting something from your motorbike when I was really young. It was scary.\\n',\n",

       " 'father:  Well, we never really got the holidays you get now, the food, etc…\\n',\n",

       " 'son:  He was a communist wasn’t he?\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Yes, and I was part of the communist party for a while too, we all grew up as a very socialist family, giving everything we had, even if we needed it. This is something that’s lacking today I think. Your grandpa used to bring home homeless people all the time, it used to drive your grandma insane!\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  why?\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  to be honest, you know how caring and giving I am to others, honestly I’m too trustworthy a lot of the time, but I’m sort of on your grandma’s side for this one. There was this one incident…\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  an incident?\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Yeah, so basically grandpa brought this homeless guy home to sleep in our house. Now bare in mind that we basically didn’t even have space for your uncle and I\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  Yeah…\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  anyways so we wake up and this guy is gone. Nothing unusual, he’s spent the night and that’s that right?\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  Yep\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Well, we go into the bathroom and the guy literally smeared shit all over the walls. Poor grandpa had to clean it all up…\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  Oh man… yeah that’s rough, I’m not sure I would have had the courage to clean that up\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Trust me, with the wrath of your grandma, he had to have the courage\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  it’s sad, you know I never really knew grandpa, but yet I still sort of miss him quite a bit, from time to time\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  well, he was there when you were younger and my god did he love you and your sister\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  I know, I remember a few things.\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Like what?\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  well, I have really clear memories of Chateau Lignan, where we used to go on holiday sometimes in the south of France\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Oh yeah, those were some really good holidays\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  anyways he would come and visit us sometimes, and bring Lola and I presents and I remember being this snotty stupid kid and never appreciating his gifts\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  What do you mean?\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  Well, I mean I would smile and say thank you and be all nice, but inside I would just really remember thinking that they were shit gifts. Like colouring books and pencils etc\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Yes, but he was always so out of touch with you guys and literally had no money to spend on you\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  I know! I know, honestly I have cried about this now. I see how beautiful of a gesture it was now and how amazing of a man he was.\\n',\n",

       " 'son:  yeah!\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Lucas, do you realise that he probably spent all of what he had for a month on that?\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  I do, you have no idea, this is the kind of stuff that makes me wish I had had more time to get to know him\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Yes, I mean that’s my fault too\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  Anyways, so he gifted me this thin gold chain with a guitar pendant on it and I recently found it again about a year ago and I never take it off!\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  No way, yeah I remember seeing that around your neck and taking the piss because you look like a gangster\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  Well it’s grandpas! I took off the guitar pendant and it never comes off of my neck\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  That’s really sweet, I bet that he would be so happy to hear that\\n',\n",

       " 'son: Oh yes! Well I wasn’t there but I certainly remember the story. He cried didn’t he?\\n',\n",
       " 'father:  Yes, I mean he was always quite an emotional man, I really respected that in him\\n',\n",
       " 'son:  Yeah, I think the older I get, the more I respect people that can tap into their emotions\\n',\n",

I mean what I mean Angela was acutely aware of that it must be extremely difficult you know to move away from everything that you knew up to that date in your life really.  Your family and it was your mother And to move away and coming to a different environment, a different location and another family really. We sort of tried really to put you at ease to make you feel at home to the best of our ability you know, but that road  had its ups and downs with it and you can't do that overnight because it is, well I felt it was sort of difficult to sort of adjust to a different family a different location.

But she also would checked out where you were and was making sure that you were okay and because of the work together with your mom and with us and that that also made you feel comfortable because you didn't have to make any choices between your mum or us. It was more than enhancing what you've already got and what's the state now is that you're close to your mum, to us and nobody feels threatened in any way as to who you know well sometimes when kids come into care they have to make a choice and it's very difficult for them because they are born with parents but the parents don't like that that bonding.

I mean my anger was tied to my mom but really I directed it everywhere. I wasn't channeling it because there was just too much channel. And going back on that it was kind of like everything that was familiar to me was the anger, the pain and the stress and then coming here and the pain and the stress were gone really quickly I mean, the anger stayed.

She was actually saying to us \"I\\'m so glad I made that decision because you got things now and you\\'re doing things now that I could never have given you you\\'ve, got the chance to do things that you really wanted to do, things that you dreamed about doing and staying with me you would have never been able to do\" so with that she was the one saying to us \"it\\'s the best decision that we could have made for you\".\\n',\n",

       "{' hey dad lets talk about your childhood i ve always been curious ': ' you know i was never as good of a kid as you ',\n",
       " ' i know you ve always mentioned ': ' i think it was different growing up in a smaller city ',\n",
       " ' probably growing up in london is a bit of a weird one ': ' in what way ',\n",
       " ' i don t know you sort of get used to having so many things and people around you ': ' that makes sense honestly i was always just looking for something to pass the time ',\n",
       " ' like what ': ' well there was bicycle that i wanted more than anything when i was a kid ',\n",
       " ' what i remember this story vaguely ': ' what happened was i got this science kit of my birthday ',\n",
       " ' the crappy ones you can buy in a toy shop ': ' yes but what i did was i collected the same chemical over and over again from different pharmacies to get enough to make the explosion enormous ',\n",
       " ' and you blew the roof off of your house ': ' well a hole yes but my parents were so poor we lived with a hole in our roof for months ',\n",
       " ' what did your parents say ': ' they were both so angry but my parents had a lot of love for me i think so it was fine in the end ',\n",
       " ' was this in winter ': ' thankfully not it did get quite cold though at times you know i do think back to those times very fondly however they were good times life was more simple but maybe that s just how it is as a kid no ',\n",
       " ' yep i remember everything being so much easier remember when i used to wake up and watch cartoons on a saturday and you used to make pancakes ': ' those were so good ',\n",
       " ' i remember the smell the most and the feeling of the warm sun coming through the windows ': ' remember all the plants we used to have ',\n",
       " ' of course ': ' it was always important for me to have you grow up around plants ',\n",
       " ' really why ': ' i m not entirely sure maybe because i had that when i was younger you know it was always a struggle for me to accept that you were growing up in a big city like london with so much at your disposal including a middle class family like i had nothing and you had everything handed to you i feel as though it was such an integral part of my education to have to fend for myself ',\n",
       " ' yes i know but honestly i feel as though you just assumed i had to learn that stuff at way too young of an age ': ' what do you mean ',\n",
       " ' well it s just i remember when you used to force me to go out and get stuff from the shops when it was dark or getting something from your motorbike when i was really young it was scary ': ' yeah i know probably not the best move ',\n",
       " ' like i know that you wanted me to be more streetwise but honestly i was like ten years old i m sure it would have come more naturally ': ' i know i m sorry i do think about these things a lot i really just didn t know sometimes ',\n",
       " ' it s ok honestly i m really way over it now ': ' i m glad ',\n",
       " ' what was your father like to you ': ' i loved him so much it was so difficult when i was growing up as i said we have nothing my dad tried and tried to make our life better but it was difficult sometimes ',\n",
       " ' in what sense ': ' well we never really got the holidays you get now the food etc ',\n",
       " ' yes but having all this doesn t make me love you more or less surely it would be the same with you and your dad ': ' oh yes completely i think i even loved him more or love him more now because i understand the effort he put into making our life better ',\n",
       " ' he was a communist wasn t he ': ' yes and i was part of the communist party for a while too we all grew up as a very socialist family giving everything we had even if we needed it this is something that s lacking today i think your grandpa used to bring home homeless people all the time it used to drive your grandma insane ',\n",
       " ' why ': ' to be honest you know how caring and giving i am to others honestly i m too trustworthy a lot of the time but i m sort of on your grandma s side for this one there was this one incident ',\n",
       " ' an incident ': ' yeah so basically grandpa brought this homeless guy home to sleep in our house now bare in mind that we basically didn t even have space for your uncle and i ',\n",
       " ' yeah ': ' you know i mean your mom used to come here and i think that that was everybody didnt look on it as you your mom didnt look at it as though somebody else were taking over her children she looked at that it in the way that she knew she couldnt cope but she also would checked out where you were and was making sure that you were okay and because of the work together with your mom and with us and that that also made you feel comfortable because you didnt have to make any choices between your mum or us it was more than enhancing what youve already got and whats the state now is that youre close to your mum to us and nobody feels threatened in any way as to who you know well sometimes when kids come into care they have to make a choice and its very difficult for them because they are born with parents but the parents dont like that that bonding so theyll try and disrupt it but marks mum didnt do that and i think that helped an awful lot at what stage were you at when you arrived here ',\n",
       " ' yep ': ' well we go into the bathroom and the guy literally smeared shit all over the walls poor grandpa had to clean it all up ',\n",
       " ' oh man yeah that s rough i m not sure i would have had the courage to clean that up ': ' trust me with the wrath of your grandma he had to have the courage ',\n",
       " ' it s sad you know i never really knew grandpa but yet i still sort of miss him quite a bit from time to time ': ' well he was there when you were younger and my god did he love you and your sister ',\n",
       " ' i know i remember a few things ': ' like what ',\n",
       " ' well i have really clear memories of chateau lignan where we used to go on holiday sometimes in the south of france ': ' oh yeah those were some really good holidays ',\n",
       " ' anyways he would come and visit us sometimes and bring lola and i presents and i remember being this snotty stupid kid and never appreciating his gifts ': ' what do you mean ',\n",
       " ' well i mean i would smile and say thank you and be all nice but inside i would just really remember thinking that they were shit gifts like colouring books and pencils etc ': ' yes but he was always so out of touch with you guys and literally had no money to spend on you ',\n",
       " ' i know i know honestly i have cried about this now i see how beautiful of a gesture it was now and how amazing of a man he was ': ' he really was ',\n",
       " ' i now wear the gold chain that he gifted me once ': ' wait he gifted you a gold chain ',\n",
       " ' i do you have no idea this is the kind of stuff that makes me wish i had had more time to get to know him ': ' yes i mean that s my fault too ',\n",
       " ' anyways so he gifted me this thin gold chain with a guitar pendant on it and i recently found it again about a year ago and i never take it off ': ' no way yeah i remember seeing that around your neck and taking the piss because you look like a gangster ',\n",
       " ' well it s grandpas i took off the guitar pendant and it never comes off of my neck ': ' that s really sweet i bet that he would be so happy to hear that ',\n",
       " ' i hope honestly i regret a lot of things when it comes to him ': ' do you remember when lola and i bought him his new dog ',\n",
       " ' oh yes well i wasn t there but i certainly remember the story he cried didn t he ': ' yes i mean he was always quite an emotional man i really respected that in him ',\n",
       " ' yeah i think the older i get the more i respect people that can tap into their emotions ': ' i think we re both getting better at that ',\n",
       " ' ': ' and you know sometimes if i don t raise my voice i just dont get listened to and then it turns into usually if i dont raise my voice and then eventually turns into if i never raise my voice i never get heard ',\n",
       " ' do what ': ' you know what i m talking ',\n",
       " ' in a minute okay ': ' no son now please ',\n",
       " ' why does it have to be this moment ': ' because i ',\n",
       " ' nope you can t remember ': ' wait what remember what ',\n",
       " ' probably like ten years ago i remember you sat me down one night i was probably like seven or ten or something ': ' that math tutor sure was worth it ',\n",
       " ' you said ahem well uh listen son i want to do things differently if you ever hear me begin to say because i said so you gotta just slap me and remind me how much i hated hearing it growing up ': ' that voice that was supposed to be what i sound like ',\n",

       " ' not at all i think it s because it was such a big part of my life when i was younger because of you that i just got bored of it eventually ': ' i know that s sort of my fault ',\n",
       " ' it s fine i mean it was fun for a while but eventually i just wanted to stay home and watch cartoons you know ': ' i know i m sorry i feel as though a lot of the stuff i did when you were younger was selfish ',\n",
       " ' no it wasn t i mean you couldn t have known ': ' it was easier when your sister was born because i already knew what i was doing to a certain extent ',\n",

       " ' do you remember when we used to get into those crazy arguments when i was younger ': ' i do when you were about 16 ',\n",
       " ' yeah damn we really didn t get along around that time ': ' yeah i guess that s because you were my first experience with raising a teenager i have thicker skin with your sister now ',\n",
       " ' no dad i also think it s because we have clashing personalities ': ' oh really in what way ',\n",
       " ' well i mean clashing and similar at the same time actually ': ' what your obsessive nature ',\n",
       " ' yeah my obsessive nature the way i obsess over everything how everything needs to be my way or i sort of internally freak out i know what i want basically i also feel like i have slight ocd from you honestly ': ' i don t have ocd ',\n",
       " ' oh man yes you do cleaning the floor twice a day and hoovering at 8am that s obsessive compulsive ': ' i just like keeping the house clean ',\n",
       " ' i know you do and i commend that it s taught me to do the same with my place now but my god it would bother me when i was younger ': ' i know ',\n",

       " ' i mean it was literally our house i needed to wear slippers everywhere ': ' that floor was special though it was some kind of weird white resin that got dirty super fast ',\n",
       " ' yeah but anyways i don t think it was just that i think that a lot of my childhood consisted of just listening to you with my tail between my legs and when i hit sixteen i kind of just wanted to do my own thing ': ' like any sixteen year old ',\n",
       " ' yes i know but i mean that s why we clashed so much i just didn t accept most of what you said or wanted me to do anymore ': ' i remember ',\n",
       " ' just silly stuff i think i started rebelling against that and just getting angry in general like those damn vegetables ': ' you never liked your vegetables lucas come on ',\n",
       " ' i did i don t know what that obsession was with you that i didn t ': ' what ',\n",
       " ' it s almost as if you felt like you wanted to find something that bothered you about me ': ' no not at all i mean i just wanted the best for your health ',\n",
       " ' yes but i very clearly ate all the vegetables that were on my plate ': ' well what about salad huh ',\n",
       " ' you know that i just never liked salad it s that simple ': ' or tomatoes ',\n",
       " ' yes ok fine or tomatoes but i felt like you would literally make those things so that i would not eat them and then you could complain ': ' oh come on i was never that petty ',\n",
       " ' fine but that s how i felt ': ' honestly i was just scared for your health that s all ',\n",
       " ' but see that s what i mean i probably ate better than most kids but you needed me to eat everything otherwise it pissed you off it s like the thing with the damn phones ': ' the phones ',\n",
       " ' yeah the phones you got obsessed with the idea that i was constantly on my phone ': ' but again you were constantly on your phone weren t you ',\n",
       " ' no i mean sure i was on it a decent amount ': ' yeah you were ',\n",
       " ' yeah but look it was the age i think ': ' it all started with that damn ipod touch that everyone wanted at your age ',\n",
       " ' oh yeah do you remember how much i wanted that thing ': ' definitely diego got one first didn t he ',\n",
       " ' yep i was so damn jealous ': ' but i got you one for christmas that year ',\n",
       " ' you did it was such an amazing gift i remember playing on it for hours ': ' that s when you started spending so much time on your devices ',\n",

       " ' understood what ': ' the whole gaming thing ',\n",
       " ' what do you mean ': ' what was so attractive about gaming on a small screen ',\n",
       " ' i don t know to be honest i was never allowed a console from you and mum so it was basically my first console ': ' that s true you never got that nintendo ds that you wanted so badly ',\n",
       " ' oh man i never wanted something more in my life i wanted it more than that tiger toy i ask for christmas when we were on holiday ': ' your mum would have been so angry at me if i would have bought you a nintendo ds ',\n",
       " ' i know i clearly remember looking at them in shops and imagining all the things i could do and how i could try and buy myself one ': ' that s cute i remember wanting things like that as a kid too ',\n",
       " ' that s such a pre naughties present to want ': ' it really is no one asks for bicycles anymore ',\n",
       " ' i mean i would definitely want a new bike now ': ' sure but when you were a kid all you wanted was mario kart or whatever ',\n",
       " ' true ': ' anyways what i was trying to say was that i was obsessed with my phone for a while because it was so exciting to me when i first got one ',\n",
       " ' i know ': ' yes but then that interest died off after a year and you kept pestering my every single time i got a text ',\n",
       " ' well yes because you would literally get a text every single second of the day ': ' see that s not true i would get a text and even if i didn t look at it you would get annoyed that i got that text for some reason ',\n",
       " ' ok maybe we were a bit overbearing with all that technology stuff ': ' i do remember however the first ipod you and mum got me ',\n",
       " ' really ': ' yeah paradou is a famous name ',\n",
       " ' oh yes of course i remember that you were so damn happy ': ' i really was especially because i was only starting to get into music back then and it was the new cool thing to do ',\n",

       " ' i remember that stage your damn black skinny jeans ': ' not too sure what was going on there in that phase of my life ',\n",

       " ' well look at you now no skinny jeans ': ' thank goodness for that huh ',\n",
