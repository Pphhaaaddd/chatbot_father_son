       " ' thankfully not, it did get quite cold though at times you know i do think back to those times very fondly however, they were good times. life was more simple, but maybe that’s just how it is as a kid no?

       " ' yes, and i was part of the communist party for a while too, we all grew up as a very socialist family, giving everything we had, even if we needed it. this is something that’s lacking today i think. your grandpa used to bring home homeless people all the time, it used to drive your grandma insane! ': ' why? ',\n",
       " ' to be honest, you know how caring and giving i am to others, honestly i’m too trustworthy a lot of the time, but i’m sort of on your grandma’s side for this one. there was this one incident… ': ' an incident? ',\n",

       " ' like what? ': ' well, that she smoked cigarettes, so as i was young and impressionable i saw that as this horrible this and it stressed me out for months thinking she was going to die ',\n",
       " ' oh yeah, those were some really good holidays ': ' anyways he would come and visit us sometimes, and bring lola and i presents and i remember being this snotty stupid kid and never appreciating his gifts ',\n",
       " ' yes, but he was always so out of touch with you guys and literally had no money to spend on you ': ' i know! i know, honestly i have cried about this now. i see how beautiful of a gesture it was now and how amazing of a man he was. ',\n",

       " ' yes, i mean that’s my fault too ': ' anyways, so he gifted me this thin gold chain with a guitar pendant on it and i recently found it again about a year ago and i never take it off! ',\n",
       " ' no way, yeah i remember seeing that around your neck and taking the piss because you look like a gangster ': ' well it’s grandpas! i took off the guitar pendant and it never comes off of my neck ',\n",

       " ' what your obsessive nature? ': ' yeah my obsessive nature, the way i obsess over everything. how everything needs to be my way, or i sort of internally freak out. i know what i want basically. i also feel like i have slight ocd from you honestly ',\n",
       " ' i don’t have ocd? ': ' oh man, yes you do. cleaning the floor twice a day and hoovering at 8am? that’s obsessive compulsive ',\n",
       " ' i just like keeping the house clean ': ' i know you do, and i commend that. it’s taught me to do the same with my place now, but my god it would bother me when i was younger ',\n",

       " ' that floor was special though, it was some kind of weird white resin that got dirty super fast ': ' yeah but anyways i don’t think it was just that, i think that a lot of my childhood consisted of just listening to you with my tail between my legs and when i hit sixteen i kind of just wanted to do my own thing ',\n",

       " ' or tomatoes? ': ' yes ok fine, or tomatoes, but i felt like you would literally make those things so that i would not eat them and then you could complain ',\n",
       " ' oh come on, i was never that petty ': ' fine, but that’s how i felt ',\n",
       " ' honestly i was just scared for your health, that’s all. ': ' but see! that’s what i mean… i probably ate better than most kids, but you needed me to eat everything otherwise it pissed you off… it’s like the thing with the damn phones! ',\n",
       " ' the phones? ': ' yeah the phones, you got obsessed with the idea that i was constantly on my phone ',\n",
       " ' but again… you were constantly on your phone weren’t you? ': ' no, i mean sure i was on it a decent amount ',\n",
       " ' yeah you were ': ' yeah, but look it was the age i think ',\n",
       " ' it all started with that damn ipod touch that everyone wanted at your age ': ' oh yeah! do you remember how much i wanted that thing? ',\n",
       " ' definitely, diego got one first didn’t he? ': ' yep, i was so damn jealous… ',\n",
       " ' but i got you one for christmas that year! ': ' you did, it was such an amazing gift. i remember playing on it for hours ',\n",
       " ' that’s when you started spending so much time on your devices! ': ' yes, but it was a whole new world for me. to be able to download any games was amazing. ',\n",

       " ' the whole gaming thing ': ' what do you mean? ',\n",
       " ' what was so attractive about gaming on a small screen? ': ' i don’t know, to be honest i was never allowed a console from you and mum so it was basically my first console. ',\n",
       " ' that’s true! you never got that nintendo ds that you wanted so badly ': ' oh man, i never wanted something more in my life… i wanted it more than that tiger toy i ask for christmas when we were on holiday ',\n",
       " ' your mum would have been so angry at me if i would have bought you a nintendo ds ': ' i know. i clearly remember looking at them in shops and imagining all the things i could do and how i could try and buy myself one ',\n",
       " ' that’s cute, i remember wanting things like that as a kid too ': ' like what? ',\n",
       " ' well there was bicycle that i wanted more than anything when i was a kid ': ' that’s such a pre-naughties present to want ',\n",
       " ' it really is, no one asks for bicycles anymore ': ' i mean i would definitely want a new bike now ',\n",
       " ' sure, but when you were a kid all you wanted was mario kart or whatever ': ' true. ',\n",
       " ' anyways, what i was trying to say was that i was obsessed with my phone for a while, because it was so exciting to me when i first got one. ': ' i know ',\n",
       " ' yes, but then that interest died off after a year and you kept pestering my every single time i got a text ': ' well yes, because you would literally get a text every single second of the day ',\n",
       " ' see, that’s not true. i would get a text and even if i didn’t look at it you would get annoyed that i got that text for some reason ': ' ok, maybe we were a bit overbearing with all that technology stuff. ',\n",
       " ' i do remember however the first ipod you and mum got me! ': ' really? ',\n",
       " ' yes it was this tiny one and it was for my birthday. you told me you had a surprise and we took the bus to this shopping centre where you let me pick one out ': ' oh yes, of course - i remember that! you were so damn happy ',\n",
       " ' i really was, especially because i was only starting to get into music back then and it was the new cool thing to do ': ' what have an ipod? ',\n",
       " ' yeah, i guess, but like collect music, be an angsty rock kid etc ': ' i remember that stage, your damn black skinny jeans ',\n",
       " ' not too sure what was going on there in that phase of my life. ': ' i remember you saying that you’d never wear anything else than black skinny jeans ',\n",
       " ' i truly believed that though ': ' well look at you now! no skinny jeans… ',\n",
       " ' thank goodness for that huh? ': ' but i clearly remember really wanting to be angsty and grunge, when truthfully that just wasn’t me ',\n",
       " ' every kid goes through that, yours wasn’t too bad ': ' did you go through that? ',\n",
       " ' i’m not too sure, i mean i remember wanting to be like my brother but i’m not too sure if there was a certain ‘group’ i wanted to belong to ': ' i’m not sure if i was trying to belong to a certain group, i think my friends did and i just wanted to be like them i guess ',\n",
       " ' which friends? ': ' like pj and max. they were so into their music, they loved playing guitar etc ',\n",
       " ' oh yeah, that was about the time where you had asked for a guitar and i got you one but you never played it, not even once? ': ' sounds about right… ',\n",
       " ' it was such a beautiful electric guitar too. did you ever even take a lesson? ': \" i don't think so \",\n",
       " ' such a shame! ': ' i know, i do regret it. ',\n",
       " ' you were never too good at the cello though ': ' that’s true, but i really hated it, plus i was forced to play it at school ',\n",

This is something that’s lacking today I think. Your grandpa used to bring home homeless people all the time, it used to drive your grandma insane!\\n',\n",
