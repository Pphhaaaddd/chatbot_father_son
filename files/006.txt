father:  And you know sometimes if I don’t raise my voice, I just don't get listened to. And then it turns into usually if I don't raise my voice and then eventually turns into if I never raise my voice I never get heard.


son:  Most of the time when you don't shout, we hear you but people do choose to ignore you.


father:  Oh that's even worse. So you listen to me then choose not to do things


son:  I rarely do that.. Maybe


father:  So it’s casually ignoring, deliberately ignoring me...


son:  What's your favorite part about mum.


father:  Your mum -  she's just great. My best friend and the person I can tell anything to and the person I share a life with.


son:  So, you would tell her that you accidentally killed someone if you accidentally killed someone?


father:  If I accidentally killed someone, I feel as though I might not tell mummy.


son:  You just said you tell her anything


father:  OK. Yeah. OK.


son:  There's always things that you may not want to share like...


father:  Like what you’re getting her for Christmas?


son:  Oh that is a perfect example. You don't share what you get people Christmas. She finds that on Christmas Day. As I haven’t actually killed someone, that I am aware of, I would not share that with her.


father:  Why did I even ask you that?.


son:  I don't know.


father:  Have you ever killed someone?


son:  No. Worst thing I ever did was accidentally throw a rock someone's head in reception


father: I threw a rock at my sister head and she had a little scar above her eyebrow. Whoops. Grandma was not happy.


son:  What did she do to you?


father:  I got told off but never got any more than told off. I was given the “you've dented your sister's head” look


son:  Yeah. You must have a similar look from mummy at times.


father:  You do that look nearly every day.


son:  I may use that look quite often…
