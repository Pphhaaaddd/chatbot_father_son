father:  How are you, son?

father:  Army? That's good.

son:  That's bad.

father:  You haven't mentioned Jennifer.

son:  What is there to say?

father:  But what did you think?


son:  She's absolutely charming.

father:  With her background, to get to Radcliffe is...

son:  Get to the point! - It doesn't concern her, but you.

father:  Your rebellion. And you are rebelling.

son:  I fail...

father:  I fail to see how marrying a brilliant Radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion.


son:  She's not some crazy hippie.

father:  She's not many things.

son:  What irks you most, that she's Catholic or poor?

father:  What attracts you most?


son:  I'm leaving.

father:  Don't go off half-cocked. I would only ask that you wait a bit.

son:  Define "bit".

father:  Finish Law School. If it's real, it'll stand the test of time.

son:  It is real, but why should I put it through a test?

father:  I'm asking you.


son:  You're commanding me!

father:  If you marry her now, I'll not give you the time of day.

son:  Father, you don't know the time of day!
