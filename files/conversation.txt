son:  Hey dad, let's talk about your childhood, I’ve always been curious


father:  You know I was never as good of a kid as you


son:  I know, you’ve always mentioned


father:  I think it was different growing up in a smaller city


son:  Probably, growing up in London is a bit of a weird one


father:  In what way?


son:  I don’t know, you sort of get used to having so many things and people around you


father:  That makes sense, honestly I was always just looking for something to pass the time


son:  Like what?


father:  So there was this one time where I actually blew the roof off of my house


son:  What? I remember this story vaguely!


father:  What happened was I got this science kit of my birthday


son:  The crappy ones you can buy in a toy shop?


father:  Yes! But what I did was I collected the same chemical over and over again from different pharmacies to get enough to make the explosion enormous


son:  … And you blew the roof off of your house?


father:  well, a hole yes - but my parents were so poor, we lived with a hole in our roof for months


son:  what did your parents say?


father:  they were both so angry, but my parents had a lot of love for me I think, so it was fine in the end


son:  was this in winter?


father:  thankfully not, it did get quite cold though at times


father:  you know I do think back to those times very fondly however, they were good times. Life was more simple, but maybe that’s just how it is as a kid no?


son:  yep, I remember everything being so much easier. Remember when I used to wake up and watch cartoons on a saturday and you used to make pancakes?


father:  those were so good!


son:  I remember the smell the most, and the feeling of the warm sun coming through the windows


father:  remember all the plants we used to have?


son:  of course!


father:  it was always important for me to have you grow up around plants


son:  really? Why?


father:  I’m not entirely sure, maybe because I had that when I was younger? you know it was always a struggle for me to accept that you were growing up in a big city like London, with so much at your disposal, including a middle class family


father: like, I had nothing, and you had everything handed to you. I feel as though it was such an integral part of my education to have to fend for myself


son:  yes I know, but honestly I feel as though you just assumed I had to learn that stuff at way too young of an age


father:  what do you mean?


son:  well it’s just I remember when you used to force me to go out and get stuff from the shops when it was dark, or getting something from your motorbike when I was really young. It was scary.


father:  Yeah I know, probably not the best move


son:  Like I know that you wanted me to be more ‘streetwise’ but honestly I was like ten years old, I’m sure it would have come more naturally.


father:  I know, I’m sorry… I do think about these things a lot. I really just didn’t know sometimes


son:  it’s ok, honestly I’m really way over it now


father:  I’m glad


son:  what was your father like to you?


father:  I loved him so much, it was so difficult when I was growing up as I said, we have nothing. My dad tried and tried to make our life better but it was difficult sometimes.


son:  In what sense?


father:  Well, we never really got the holidays you get now, the food, etc…


son:  Yes, but having all this doesn’t make me love you more or less? Surely it would be the same with you and your dad?


father:  Oh yes, completely. I think I even loved him more, or love him more now because I understand the effort he put into making our life better.


son:  He was a communist wasn’t he?


father:  Yes, and I was part of the communist party for a while too, we all grew up as a very socialist family, giving everything we had, even if we needed it. This is something that’s lacking today I think. Your grandpa used to bring home homeless people all the time, it used to drive your grandma insane!


son:  why?


father:  to be honest, you know how caring and giving I am to others, honestly I’m too trustworthy a lot of the time, but I’m sort of on your grandma’s side for this one. There was this one incident…


son:  an incident?


father:  Yeah, so basically grandpa brought this homeless guy home to sleep in our house. Now bare in mind that we basically didn’t even have space for your uncle and I


son:  Yeah…


father:  anyways so we wake up and this guy is gone. Nothing unusual, he’s spent the night and that’s that right?


son:  Yep


father:  Well, we go into the bathroom and the guy literally smeared shit all over the walls. Poor grandpa had to clean it all up…


son:  Oh man… yeah that’s rough, I’m not sure I would have had the courage to clean that up


father:  Trust me, with the wrath of your grandma, he had to have the courage


son:  it’s sad, you know I never really knew grandpa, but yet I still sort of miss him quite a bit, from time to time


father:  well, he was there when you were younger and my god did he love you and your sister


son:  I know, I remember a few things.


father:  Like what?


son:  well, I have really clear memories of Chateau Lignan, where we used to go on holiday sometimes in the south of France


father:  Oh yeah, those were some really good holidays


son:  anyways he would come and visit us sometimes, and bring Lola and I presents and I remember being this snotty stupid kid and never appreciating his gifts


father:  What do you mean?


son:  Well, I mean I would smile and say thank you and be all nice, but inside I would just really remember thinking that they were shit gifts. Like colouring books and pencils etc


father:  Yes, but he was always so out of touch with you guys and literally had no money to spend on you


son:  I know! I know, honestly I have cried about this now. I see how beautiful of a gesture it was now and how amazing of a man he was.


father:  He really was…


son:  I now wear the gold chain that he gifted me once


father:  Wait he gifted you a gold chain?


son:  yeah!


father:  Lucas, do you realise that he probably spent all of what he had for a month on that?


son:  I do, you have no idea, this is the kind of stuff that makes me wish I had had more time to get to know him


father:  Yes, I mean that’s my fault too


son:  Anyways, so he gifted me this thin gold chain with a guitar pendant on it and I recently found it again about a year ago and I never take it off!


father:  No way, yeah I remember seeing that around your neck and taking the piss because you look like a gangster


son:  Well it’s grandpas! I took off the guitar pendant and it never comes off of my neck


father:  That’s really sweet, I bet that he would be so happy to hear that


son:  I hope, honestly I regret a lot of things when it comes to him.


father:  Do you remember when Lola and I bought him his new dog?


son: Oh yes! Well I wasn’t there but I certainly remember the story. He cried didn’t he?


father:  Yes, I mean he was always quite an emotional man, I really respected that in him


son:  Yeah, I think the older I get, the more I respect people that can tap into their emotions


father:  I think we’re both getting better at that


son:  Yeah definitely




CONVERSATION TWO (Found):

father: Did you do it yet?

son: Do what?

father: You know what I’m talking—

son: In a minute, okay?

father: No, son. Now. Please.

son: Why does it have to be this moment?

father: Because I…

son: Nope. You can’t! Remember?

father: Wait…What? Remember what?

son: Probably like…ten years ago. I remember! You sat me down one night. I was probably like seven or ten or something.

father: That math tutor sure was worth it.

son: You said, “Ahem, well, uh…listen son. I want to do things differently…If you ever hear me begin to say ‘Because I said so’ you gotta just slap me and remind me how much I hated hearing it growing up.”

father: That voice…that was supposed to be what I sound like?

son: Seriously though.

father: I am serious. I need you to do it…now. Soon. Your mother will be here any time.

son: And that’s my problem because…

father: C’mon, man. I can’t do this right now. You’re almost a grown man. It’s time to start taking…

son: Care of myself. Yeah. I get it. You and Mom are ready for me to be out.

father: Well, you’ve already finished one year of coll–

son: Save it, Dad! I know!

father: Whoa! What’s with that shit?

son: I’ll do it! I mean…Jesus! Why does it matter so much?

father: It just does. I guess you’ll…

son: Oh shit…lemme guess. understand better when I’m a father?

father: I, uh..wasn’t going to say that.

son: Right.

father: Okay, fine. Just…please do it. Like I said, she’ll be here soon.

son: Have you always been afraid of her?

father: What did you just say?

son: I said, ‘Have you always been afraid of her?’

father: What the fuck, man?

son: Touch a nerve?

father: I’m about to…

son: Hey!

father: College is changing you, son. In ways I didn’t expect.

son: Wait. Come back. Dad!

father: What.

son: I’ m sorry. That was…out of line, I guess.

father: Oh, you guess?

son: It was. I’m sorry.

father: I’m…sorry too.

son: What do you have to be sorry fo?. I deserved it.

father: No. You really didn’t. Not now. Defnitely not when you were younger.

son: I’d…actually disagree. It made me who I am.

father: But you gotta understand, son. It’s not something dads want at the top of their parenting resume.

son: What’s the big deal? You spanked your kids when they acted up. Who doesn’t do that?

father: Well, your mother for one.

son: I meant dads.

father: Well…mine didn’t.

son: But he wasn’t in your life.

father: Uh-huh.

son: Okay. Here’s my thing. I mean, kids are going to test you. Shit, Dad. I just did not two seconds ago. At least when they’re a certain age, you gotta set ‘em straight, right?

father: Can I sit on that thing?

son: What, the bookshelf?

father: No. That?

son: Oh. Sure. Lemme just….here ya go.

father: Thanks. Huh. More comfy than I woulda imagined.

son: We got it worn in this past year, my roommate and I.

father: I’d say so. Wait.

son: What?

father: Um…did you, ya know…with anyone on this?

son: Um…

father: I’ll get a chair.

son: Sorry, Dad.

father: It’s fine. Glad I asked, at least.

son: Why don’t we just go get some coffee.

father: That’d be nice…except you didn’t do what I came in here for in the first place.

son: Shit. Okay. I’m willing to do it.

father: That’s remarkable.

son: Okay, okay. I get it.

father: Do you?

son: Ha! Not really. But I feel guilty now. You know…your back, or whatever.

father: Just don’t be in a rush to get older, son.

son: You kiddin’? I’m never gettin’ old.

father: Don’t let your mother hear you say that.

son: Ugh…she takes everything I say the wrong way.

father: son…she’s a mother. She just cares.

son: I know, Dad. I know. But I’ll bet she only tells you part of the story.

father: Are you suggesting that your mother would not be completely open with me?

son: What? What’s that mean?

father: I was just being a dick.

son: Ha!

father: Okay. I’m gonna get a chair. I’d prefer not to sit on that bed…for obvious reasons. In the meantime, please do it. Begin it. Do something to exhibit you heard her earlier and want to make her happy. She likes that.

son: Being happy?

father: You know what I mean.

son: Okay….Dad! Don’t!!

father: Why’d that happen?

son: I forgot those were there.

father: You couldn’t even finish it?

son: Shit. I forgot I put it down last night.

father: Now we’re both in it. She’s going to get here any second and we’ll be sopping up warm beer off that new carpet.

son: Shit.

father: Dammit! It was one of the imports too!

son: Yeah. Lemme get some cleaning stuff. Didn’t know you liked those fancy beers.

father: I splurge from time to time. Didn’t know you thought it was okay to drink in this house. You forget you’re only nineteen?

son: No. That’s impossible.

father: Well, now we’re both in it. The room’s not clean. There’s beer on that new carpet. She’s going to be triple-pissed. So much for a fun weekend.

son: Dad! Relax!

father: Shit!

son: What’s wrong?

father: Oh, no!!

son: Is it your back?

father: Yeah, son! I’m a grown man crouched on the fucking floor!

son: What can I do?

father: Oh my god! Goddammit!

son: Dad! Relax!

father: Shut up!

son: I mean, don’t let it tense up! Here…sort of fall into this beanbag.

father: But you…

son: Just do it, Dad!

father: I don’t want to think about what’s rubbed up against this fucking thing!

son: Then don’t!

father: She’d better have been worth it is all I’m saying. This is torture.

son: Do you have any…pills or anything you need?

father: In my…I mean…wait. Lemme think. I uh..put them…

son: Dad! Think! Where were you the last time you took them?

father: Yelling at me isn’t going to speed up my memory!

son: Okay! I’m sorry! I’ve just never seen you…

father: Nightstand.

son: What?

father: For God’s sake…I took them a couple nights ago right before I went to sleep. They must be next to my bed.

son: Okay. Just…breathe…

father: I’m not having a baby, son.

son: I mean…relax. I’ll be right back.

father: Check around the floor if they aren’t on there!

son: Dad?

father: Did you find them?

son: Sort of.

father: What? Jesus. Either you did or you didn’t.

son: Well, you were right. They were next to your bed.

father: Gimme two. And some water from your bathroom will be fine.

son: The bottle’s empty.

father: What?!

son: All I found was the empty bottle.

father: How can that be? I just filled it….lemme see…when did we go…

son: It says a refill is allowed but with doctor’s approval.

father: Shit. It’s Saturday.

son: So it can’t be filled until Monday?

father: Fuck it. I’ll just lay here face down in….ugh…whatever’s been on this beanbag until Monday.

son: Wait! I hear Mom.

father: We’re both fucked now.

son: What does that mean?

father: I was kidding. Go get the door for her.

son: Hey, mom! Is that dad’s prescription? When did you get that purse?



CONVERSATION Three (Found):


father:  How are you, son?


son:  I'm OK

father:  Did you hear from Law School?

son:  Yes. I called you, remember?


father:  Yes. Congratulations.

father:  You'll be on the Supreme Court.


son:  I may just chase ambulances.

father:  Fine. How's Raymond?

son:  He's fine. Got into OCS.

father:  Army? That's good.

son:  That's bad.

father:  You haven't mentioned Jennifer.

son:  What is there to say?

father:  But what did you think?


son:  She's absolutely charming.

father:  With her background, to get to Radcliffe is...

son:  Get to the point! - It doesn't concern her, but you.

father:  Your rebellion. And you are rebelling.

son:  I fail...

father:  I fail to see how marrying a brilliant Radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion.


son:  She's not some crazy hippie.

father:  She's not many things.

son:  What irks you most, that she's Catholic or poor?

father:  What attracts you most?


son:  I'm leaving.

father:  Don't go off half-cocked. I would only ask that you wait a bit.

son:  Define "bit".

father:  Finish Law School. If it's real, it'll stand the test of time.

son:  It is real, but why should I put it through a test?

father:  I'm asking you.


son:  You're commanding me!

father:  If you marry her now, I'll not give you the time of day.

son:  Father, you don't know the time of day!



CONVERSATION Four:


father:  You know, I’m really glad that you’re cycling now instead of taking the tube. Not only is it cheaper but you’re getting your exercise in!


son:  Yes I know… You’ve always said this to me, I’m really glad as it’s saving me money but I don’t think I’ll ever really get into cycling as a sport that I want to do


father:  I know, you’ve never really been interested have you?


son:  Not at all, I think it’s because it was such a big part of my life when I was younger because of you that I just got bored of it eventually


father:  I know, that’s sort of my fault.


son:  It’s fine, I mean it was fun for a while, but eventually I just wanted to stay home and watch cartoons you know?


father:  I know, I’m sorry, I feel as though a lot of the stuff I did when you were younger was selfish


son:  No it wasn’t, I mean you couldn’t have known?


father:  It was easier when your sister was born because I already knew what I was doing to a certain extent


son:  Yes, but for me it got harder with you, especially after the divorce really…


father:  How?


son:  Well everything changed and it became very difficult to deal with everything. I mean I felt like I had to suddenly grow up. It wasn’t fair


father:  I know, I think I’ve always known but I never really talked to you about it


son:  It’s ok, it’s in the past now, but honestly it was really difficult.


father:  It was a difficult time for me too, your mum leaving me wasn’t fun in any way


son:  I know that but I was so young and I didn’t really know what was happening


father:  I know I’m sorry


son:  And I didn’t know how to react, who to trust, what to do…


father:  What do you mean who to trust?


son:  Well, I felt like you guys were creating sides in a sense, like as if I had to pick one


father:  I never really felt that way


son:  Really? Are you sure? Because you used to tell me some stuff about mum which was clearly untrue and then I would side with you for a while. It really fucked with my head


father:  Like what?


son:  Well, that she smoked cigarettes, so as I was young and impressionable I saw that as this horrible this and it stressed me out for months thinking she was going to die


father:  Look, I was in a bad place ok? I’m sorry


son:  Yes I know, I guess I’m just brining this up because we’re having this conversation now but I’m not holding any grudges really


father:  Are you sure?


son:  Yeah I think so, I mean I can’t really know what’s going on, deep down in my subconscious but I really don’t think I ever see you badly really


father:  I’m really thankful for that


son:  Yeah, well I mean you still piss me off sometimes


father:  And you still piss me off sometimes!


son:  Do you remember when we used to get into those crazy arguments when I was younger?


father:  I do, when you were about 16?


son:  Yeah damn, we really didn’t get along around that time


father:  Yeah I guess that’s because you were my first experience with raising a teenager. I have thicker skin with your sister now


son:  No dad, I also think it’s because we have clashing personalities


father:  Oh really, in what way?


son:  Well, I mean clashing and similar at the same time actually?


father:  What your obsessive nature?


son:  Yeah my obsessive nature, the way I obsess over everything. How everything needs to be my way, or I sort of internally freak out. I know what I want basically. I also feel like I have slight OCD from you honestly


father:  I don’t have OCD?


son:  Oh man, yes you do. Cleaning the floor twice a day and hoovering at 8am? That’s obsessive compulsive


father:  I just like keeping the house clean


son:  I know you do, and I commend that. It’s taught me to do the same with my place now, but my god it would bother me when I was younger


father:  I know


son:  Like for example the way you’d go nuts if we walked on the floor with our bare feet?


father:  Yeah


son:  I mean it was literally our house, I needed to wear slippers everywhere


father:  That floor was special though, it was some kind of weird white resin that got dirty super fast


son:  Yeah but anyways I don’t think it was just that, I think that a lot of my childhood consisted of just listening to you with my tail between my legs and when I hit sixteen I kind of just wanted to do my own thing


father:  Like any sixteen year old


son:  Yes I know but I mean that’s why we clashed so much, I just didn’t accept most of what you said or wanted me to do anymore


father:  I remember


son:  Just silly stuff, I think I started rebelling against that and just getting angry in general… Like those damn vegetables.


father:  You never liked your vegetables Lucas, come on…


son:  I did, I don’t know what that obsession was with you that I didn’t


father:  What?


son:  It’s almost as if you felt like you wanted to find something that bothered you about me


father:  No not at all, I mean I just wanted the best for your health


son:  Yes but I very clearly ate all the vegetables that were on my plate


father:  Well, what about salad huh?


son:  You know that I just never liked salad, it’s that simple


father:  Or tomatoes?


son:  Yes ok fine, or tomatoes, but I felt like you would literally make those things so that I would not eat them and then you could complain


father:  oh come on, I was never that petty


son:  Fine, but that’s how I felt


father:  Honestly I was just scared for your health, that’s all.


son:  But see! That’s what I mean… I probably ate better than most kids, but you needed me to eat everything otherwise it pissed you off… It’s like the thing with the damn phones!


father:  The phones?


son:  Yeah the phones, you got obsessed with the idea that I was constantly on my phone


father:  But again… you were constantly on your phone weren’t you?


son:  No, I mean sure I was on it a decent amount


father:  Yeah you were


son:  Yeah, but look it was the age I think


father:  It all started with that damn iPod touch that everyone wanted at your age


son:  Oh yeah! Do you remember how much I wanted that thing?


father:  Definitely, Diego got one first didn’t he?


son:  Yep, I was so damn jealous…


father:  But I got you one for christmas that year!


son:  You did, it was such an amazing gift. I remember playing on it for hours


father:  That’s when you started spending so much time on your devices!


son:  Yes, but it was a whole new world for me. To be able to download any games was amazing.


father:  I never really understood that


son:  Understood what?


father:  The whole gaming thing


son:  What do you mean?


father:  What was so attractive about gaming on a small screen?


son:  I don’t know, to be honest I was never allowed a console from you and mum so it was basically my first console.


father:  That’s true! You never got that Nintendo DS that you wanted so badly


son:  Oh man, I never wanted something more in my life… I wanted it more than that tiger toy I ask for Christmas when we were on holiday


father:  Your mum would have been so angry at me if I would have bought you a Nintendo DS


son:  I know. I clearly remember looking at them in shops and imagining all the things I could do and how I could try and buy myself one


father:  That’s cute, I remember wanting things like that as a kid too


son:  Like what?


father:  Well there was bicycle that I wanted more than anything when I was a kid


son:  That’s such a pre-naughties present to want


father:  It really is, no one asks for bicycles anymore


son:  I mean I would definitely want a new bike now


father:  Sure, but when you were a kid all you wanted was mario kart or whatever


son:  True.


father:  Anyways, what I was trying to say was that I was obsessed with my phone for a while, because it was so exciting to me when I first got one.


son:  I know


father:  Yes, but then that interest died off after a year and you kept pestering my every single time I got a text


son:  Well yes, because you would literally get a text every single second of the day


father:  See, that’s not true. I would get a text and even if I didn’t look at it you would get annoyed that I got that text for some reason


son:  Ok, maybe we were a bit overbearing with all that technology stuff.


father:  I do remember however the first ipod you and mum got me!


son:  Really?


father:  Yes it was this tiny one and it was for my birthday. You told me you had a surprise and we took the bus to this shopping centre where you let me pick one out


son:  Oh yes, of course - I remember that! You were so damn happy


father:  I really was, especially because I was only starting to get into music back then and it was the new cool thing to do


son:  What have an ipod?


father:  Yeah, I guess, but like collect music, be an angsty rock kid etc


son:  I remember that stage, your damn black skinny jeans


father:  Not too sure what was going on there in that phase of my life.


son:  I remember you saying that you’d never wear anything else than black skinny jeans


father:  I truly believed that though


son:  Well look at you now! No skinny jeans…


father:  Thank goodness for that huh?


son:  But I clearly remember really wanting to be angsty and grunge, when truthfully that just wasn’t me


father:  Every kid goes through that, yours wasn’t too bad


son:  Did you go through that?


father:  I’m not too sure, I mean I remember wanting to be like my brother but I’m not too sure if there was a certain ‘group’ I wanted to belong to


son:  I’m not sure if I was trying to belong to a certain group, I think my friends did and I just wanted to be like them I guess


father:  Which friends?


son:  Like PJ and Max. They were so into their music, they loved playing guitar etc


father:  Oh yeah, that was about the time where you had asked for a guitar and I got you one but you never played it, not even once?


son:  Sounds about right…


father:  It was such a beautiful electric guitar too. Did you ever even take a lesson?


son:  I don't think so


father:  Such a shame!


son:  I know, I do regret it.


father:  You were never too good at the cello though


son:  That’s true, but I really hated it, plus I was forced to play it at school


father:  I think you were too young to appreciate it


son:  Probably yes.  I do also regret not getting into skateboarding really


father:  No you were good! I remember


son:  That’s not true, that’s just the father in you talking. I couldn’t do any tricks!


father:  We got you some lessons though?


son:  Yes, but I don’t know, it’s just one of those hundreds of things I thought I would love doing and then ended up getting bored of…


father:  You never got bored of your computer though!


son:  Yes I know… I was a bit of a geeky kid, literally the opposite of you


father:  No! I didn’t mean it like that, I’m so proud of you. You always help me with my computer and you’re all self taught!


son:  I mean yes, but most people of my generation know how to use a computer correctly


father:  I know, but I’m still proud of you


son:  Thanks dad


CONVERSATION FIVE (FOUND):


father:  Often we'd sit and have nothing to discuss and it's only actually after he's passed away that I then think of those points that I'd like to question him about or perhaps discuss with him. I'm not that good at small talk. Well I find that in certain social situations and I think you've observed it particularly when I'm among other Nigerians. Then I suppose a different part of my character emerges that is actually looking back to a time in my life when --


son:  From your school period?


father:  Yeah and I wouldn't normally talk about things like I suppose experiences…


son:   With grandpa is there stuff that you wish you spoke to to him about then?


father:  Yes quite a lot. At the time I wouldn't really know what to talk about.


son:  I was just surprised to hear you say that there was stuff you needed to talk about, you know? because in my opinion it was quite hard to try and get conversation from him.


father:  I mean it's interesting that you say that as well that it was it was difficult to get him to... to converse.


son:  Yeah


father:  And if you actually got him on a subject that he enjoyed then he would talk at length on other things he wouldn't talk very much. So whereas your grandmother it's different. She likes to talk and I don't think she'd mind


son:  Both of them to be fair


father:  Yes and she would like to have had the same degree of I suppose interaction from a conversation point of view but then I suppose that's one of the differences between men and women as well.


son:  I think it probably didn't help him in the long scheme of things as they're married and as they get closer, Grandma became more of the spokesperson of the couple which probably led to a less communicative grandpa, but with grandma as well especially now that she's on her own she's more isolated. We should probably make more of an effort. I mean not that we shouldn't have made more of an effort with grandpa but with grandma being on her own I don't want her to be sort of cut off in in sense

father:  And you know sometimes if I don’t raise my voice, I just don't get listened to. And then it turns into usually if I don't raise my voice and then eventually turns into if I never raise my voice I never get heard.


son:  Most of the time when you don't shout, we hear you but people do choose to ignore you.


father:  Oh that's even worse. So you listen to me then choose not to do things


son:  I rarely do that.. Maybe


father:  So it’s casually ignoring, deliberately ignoring me...


son:  What's your favorite part about mum.


father:  Your mum -  she's just great. My best friend and the person I can tell anything to and the person I share a life with.


son:  So, you would tell her that you accidentally killed someone if you accidentally killed someone?


father:  If I accidentally killed someone, I feel as though I might not tell mummy.


son:  You just said you tell her anything


father:  OK. Yeah. OK.


son:  There's always things that you may not want to share like...


father:  Like what you’re getting her for Christmas?


son:  Oh that is a perfect example. You don't share what you get people Christmas. She finds that on Christmas Day. As I haven’t actually killed someone, that I am aware of, I would not share that with her.


father:  Why did I even ask you that?.


son:  I don't know.


father:  Have you ever killed someone?


son:  No. Worst thing I ever did was accidentally throw a rock someone's head in reception


father: I threw a rock at my sister head and she had a little scar above her eyebrow. Whoops. Grandma was not happy.


son:  What did she do to you?


father:  I got told off but never got any more than told off. I was given the “you've dented your sister's head” look


son:  Yeah. You must have a similar look from mummy at times.


father:  You do that look nearly every day.


son:  I may use that look quite often…
