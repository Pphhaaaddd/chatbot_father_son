you know i was never as good of a kid as you i know you’ve always mentioned i think it was different growing up in a smaller city probably growing up in london is a bit of a weird one in what way i don’t know you sort of get used to having so many things and people around you that makes sense honestly i was always just looking for something to pass the time like what so there was this one time where i actually blew the roof off of my house what i remember this story vaguely what happened was i got this science kit of my birthday the crappy ones you can buy in a toy shop yes but what i did was i collected the same chemical over and over again from different pharmacies to get enough to make the explosion enormous … and you blew the roof off of your house well a hole yes - but my parents were so poor we lived with a hole in our roof for months what did your parents say they were both so angry but my parents had a lot of love for me i think so it was fine in the end was this in winter thankfully not it did get quite cold though at times you know i do think back to those times very fondly however they were good times life was more simple but maybe that’s just how it is as a kid no yep i remember everything being so much easier remember when i used to wake up and watch cartoons on a saturday and you used to make pancakes those were so good i remember the smell the most and the feeling of the warm sun coming through the windows remember all the plants we used to have of course it was always important for me to have you grow up around plants really why i’m not entirely sure maybe because i had that when i was younger you know it was always a struggle for me to accept that you were growing up in a big city like london with so much at your disposal including a middle class family like i had nothing and you had everything handed to you i feel as though it was such an integral part of my education to have to fend for myself yes i know but honestly i feel as though you just assumed i had to learn that stuff at way too young of an age what do you mean well i mean i would smile and say thank you and be all nice but inside i would just really remember thinking that they were shit gifts like colouring books and pencils etc yeah i know probably not the best move like i know that you wanted me to be more ‘streetwise’ but honestly i was like ten years old i’m sure it would have come more naturally i know i’m sorry… i do think about these things a lot i really just didn’t know sometimes it’s ok honestly i’m really way over it now i’m glad what was your father like to you i loved him so much it was so difficult when i was growing up as i said we have nothing my dad tried and tried to make our life better but it was difficult sometimes in what sense well we never really got the holidays you get now the food etc… yes but having all this doesn’t make me love you more or less surely it would be the same with you and your dad oh yes completely i think i even loved him more or love him more now because i understand the effort he put into making our life better he was a communist wasn’t he yes and i was part of the communist party for a while too we all grew up as a very socialist family giving everything we had even if we needed it this is something that’s lacking today i think your grandpa used to bring home homeless people all the time it used to drive your grandma insane why to be honest you know how caring and giving i am to others honestly i’m too trustworthy a lot of the time but i’m sort of on your grandma’s side for this one there was this one incident… an incident yeah so basically grandpa brought this homeless guy home to sleep in our house now bare in mind that we basically didn’t even have space for your uncle and i yeah… anyways so we wake up and this guy is gone nothing unusual he’s spent the night and that’s that right yep well we go into the bathroom and the guy literally smeared shit all over the walls poor grandpa had to clean it all up… oh man… yeah that’s rough i’m not sure i would have had the courage to clean that up trust me with the wrath of your grandma he had to have the courage it’s sad you know i never really knew grandpa but yet i still sort of miss him quite a bit from time to time well he was there when you were younger and my god did he love you and your sister i know i remember a few things like what well that she smoked cigarettes so as i was young and impressionable i saw that as this horrible this and it stressed me out for months thinking she was going to die oh yeah those were some really good holidays anyways he would come and visit us sometimes and bring lola and i presents and i remember being this snotty stupid kid and never appreciating his gifts yes but he was always so out of touch with you guys and literally had no money to spend on you i know i know honestly i have cried about this now i see how beautiful of a gesture it was now and how amazing of a man he was he really was… i now wear the gold chain that he gifted me once wait he gifted you a gold chain yeah lucas do you realise that he probably spent all of what he had for a month on that i do you have no idea this is the kind of stuff that makes me wish i had had more time to get to know him yes i mean that’s my fault too anyways so he gifted me this thin gold chain with a guitar pendant on it and i recently found it again about a year ago and i never take it off no way yeah i remember seeing that around your neck and taking the piss because you look like a gangster well it’s grandpas i took off the guitar pendant and it never comes off of my neck that’s really sweet i bet that he would be so happy to hear that i hope honestly i regret a lot of things when it comes to him do you remember when lola and i bought him his new dog oh yes well i wasn’t there but i certainly remember the story he cried didn’t he yes i mean he was always quite an emotional man i really respected that in him yeah i think the older i get the more i respect people that can tap into their emotions i think we’re both getting better at that yeah definitely did you do it yet do what you know what i’m talking— in a minute okay no son now please why does it have to be this moment because i… nope you can’t remember wait…what remember what probably like…ten years ago i remember you sat me down one night i was probably like seven or ten or something that math tutor sure was worth it you said “ahem well uh…listen son i want to do things differently…if you ever hear me begin to say ‘because i said so’ you gotta just slap me and remind me how much i hated hearing it growing up” that voice…that was supposed to be what i sound like seriously though i am serious i need you to do it…now soon your

that purse how are you son i'm ok did you hear from law school yes i called you remember yes congratulations you'll be on the supreme court i may just chase ambulances fine how's raymond he's fine got into ocs army that's good that's bad you haven't mentioned jennifer what is there to say but what did you think she's absolutely charming with her background to get to radcliffe is get to the point - it doesn't concern her but you your rebellion and you are rebelling i fail i fail to see how marrying a brilliant radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion she's not some crazy hippie she's not many things what irks you most that she's catholic or poor what attracts you most i'm leaving don't go off half-cocked i would only ask that you wait a bit define "bit" finish law school if it's real it'll stand the test of time it is real but why should i put it through a test i'm asking you you're commanding me if you marry her now i'll not give you the time of day father you don't know the time of day you know i’m really glad that you’re cycling now instead of taking the tube not only is it cheaper but you’re getting your exercise in yes i know… you’ve always said this to me i’m really glad as it’s saving me money but i don’t think i’ll ever really get into cycling as a sport that i want to do i know you’ve never really been interested have you not at all i think it’s because it was such a big part of my life when i was younger because of you that i just got bored of it eventually i know that’s sort of my fault it’s fine i mean it was fun for a while but eventually i just wanted to stay home and watch cartoons you know i know i’m sorry i feel as though a lot of the stuff i did when you were younger was selfish no it wasn’t i mean you couldn’t have known it was easier when your sister was born because i already knew what i was doing to a certain extent yes but for me it got harder with you especially after the divorce really… how well everything changed and it became very difficult to deal with everything i mean i felt like i had to suddenly grow up it wasn’t fair i know i think i’ve always known but i never really talked to you about it it’s ok it’s in the past now but honestly it was really difficult it was a difficult time for me too your mum leaving me wasn’t fun in any way i know that but i was so young and i didn’t really know what was happening i know i’m sorry and i didn’t know how to react who to trust what to do… what do you mean who to trust well i felt like you guys were creating sides in a sense like as if i had to pick one i never really felt that way really are you sure because you used to tell me some stuff about mum which was clearly untrue and then i would side with you for a while it really fucked with my head look i was in a bad place ok i’m sorry yes i know i guess i’m just brining this up because we’re having this conversation now but i’m not holding any grudges really are you sure yeah i think so i mean i can’t really know what’s going on deep down in my subconscious but i really don’t think i ever see you badly really i’m really thankful for that yeah well i mean you still piss me off sometimes and you still piss me off sometimes do you remember when we used to get into those crazy arguments when i was younger i do when you were about 16 yeah damn we really didn’t get along around that time yeah i guess that’s because you were my first experience with raising a teenager i have thicker skin with your sister now no dad i also think it’s because we have clashing personalities oh really in what way well i mean clashing and similar at the same time actually what your obsessive nature yeah my obsessive nature the way i obsess over everything how everything needs to be my way or i sort of internally freak out i know what i want basically i also feel like i have slight ocd from you honestly i don’t have ocd oh man yes you do cleaning the floor twice a day and hoovering at 8am that’s obsessive compulsive i just like keeping the house clean i know you do and i commend that it’s taught me to do the same with my place now but my god it would bother me when i was younger i know like for example the way you’d go nuts if we walked on the floor with our bare feet yeah and then i have a program that transcribes it to text so it will be able to tell who you are and who i am that floor was special though it was some kind of weird white resin that got dirty super fast yeah but anyways i don’t think it was just that i think that a lot of my childhood consisted of just listening to you with my tail between my legs and when i hit sixteen i kind of just wanted to do my own thing like any sixteen year old yes i know but i mean that’s why we clashed so much i just didn’t accept most of what you said or wanted me to do anymore i remember just silly stuff i think i started rebelling against that and just getting angry in general… like those damn vegetables you never liked your vegetables lucas come on… i did i don’t know what that obsession was with you that i didn’t no not at all i mean i just wanted the best for your health yes but i very clearly ate all the vegetables that were on my plate well what about salad huh you know that i just never liked salad it’s that simple or tomatoes yes ok fine or tomatoes but i felt like you would literally make those things so that i would not eat them and then you could complain oh come on i was never that petty fine but that’s how i felt honestly i was just scared for your health that’s all but see that’s what i mean… i probably ate better than most kids but you needed me to eat everything otherwise it pissed you off… it’s like the thing with the damn phones the phones yeah the phones you got obsessed with the idea that i was constantly on my phone but again… you were constantly on your phone weren’t you no i mean sure i was on it a decent amount yeah you were yeah but look it was the age i think it all started with that damn ipod touch that everyone wanted at your age oh yeah do you remember how much i wanted that thing definitely diego got one first didn’t he yep i was so damn jealous… but i got you one for christmas that year you did it was such an amazing gift i remember playing on it for hours that’s when you started spending so much time on your devices yes but it was a whole new world for me to be able to download any games was amazing i never really understood that understood what the whole gaming thing what do you mean what was so attractive about gaming on a small screen i don’t know to be honest i was never allowed a console from you and mum so it was basically my first console that’s true you never got that nintendo ds that you wanted so badly oh man i never wanted something more in my life… i wanted it more than that tiger toy i ask for christmas when we were on holiday your mum would have been so angry at me if i would have bought you a nintendo ds i know i clearly remember looking at them in shops and imagining all the things i could do and how i could try and buy myself one that’s cute i remember wanting things like that as a kid too like what well there was bicycle that i wanted more than anything when i was a kid that’s such a pre-naughties present to want it really is no one asks for bicycles anymore i mean i would definitely want a new bike now sure but when you were a kid all you wanted was mario kart or whatever true anyways what i was trying to say was that i was obsessed with my phone for a while because it was so exciting to me when i first got one i know yes but then that interest died off after a year and you kept pestering my every single time i got a text well yes because you would literally get a text every single second of the day see that’s not true i would get a text and even if i didn’t look at it you would get annoyed that i got that text for some reason ok maybe we were a bit overbearing with all that technology stuff i do remember however the first ipod you and mum got me really yes it was this tiny one and it was for my birthday you told me you had a surprise and we took the bus to this shopping centre where you let me pick one out oh yes of course - i remember that you were so damn happy i really was especially because i was only starting to get into music back then and it was the new cool thing to do what have an ipod yeah i guess but like collect music be an angsty rock kid etc i remember that stage your damn black skinny jeans not too sure what was going on there in that phase of my life i remember you saying that you’d never wear anything else than black skinny jeans i truly believed that though well look at you now no skinny jeans… thank goodness for that huh but i clearly remember really wanting to be angsty and grunge when truthfully that just wasn’t me every kid goes through that yours wasn’t too bad did you go through that i’m not too sure i mean i remember wanting to be like my brother but i’m not too sure if there was a certain ‘group’ i wanted to belong to i’m not sure if i was trying to belong to a certain group i think my friends did and i just wanted to be like them i guess which friends like pj and max they were so into their music they loved playing guitar etc oh yeah that was about the time where you had asked for a guitar and i got you one but you never played it not even once sounds about right… it was such a beautiful electric guitar too did you ever even take a lesson i don't think so such a shame i know i do regret it you were never too good at the cello though that’s true but i really hated it plus i was forced to play it at school i think you were too young to appreciate it probably yes i do also regret not getting into skateboarding really no you were good i remember that’s not true that’s just the father in you talking i couldn’t do any tricks we got you some lessons though yes but i don’t know it’s just one of those hundreds of things i thought i would love doing and then ended up getting bored of… you never got bored of your computer though yes i know… i was a bit of a geeky kid literally the opposite of you no i didn’t mean it like that i’m so proud of you you always help me with my computer and you’re all self taught i mean yes but most people of my generation know how to use a computer correctly i know but i’m still proud of you thanks dad often we'd sit and have nothing to discuss and it's only actually after he's passed away that i then think of those points that i'd like to question him about or perhaps discuss with him i'm not that good at small talk well i find that in certain social situations and i think you've observed it particularly when i'm among other nigerians then i suppose a different part of my character emerges that is actually looking back to a time in my life when -- from your school period yeah and i wouldn't normally talk about things like i suppose experiences… with grandpa is there stuff that you wish you spoke to to him about then yes quite a lot at the time i wouldn't really know what to talk about i was just surprised to hear you say that there was stuff you needed to talk about you know because in my opinion it was quite hard to try and get conversation from him i mean it's interesting that you say that as well that it was it was difficult to get him to to converse yeah and if you actually got him on a subject that he enjoyed then he would talk at length on other things he wouldn't talk very much so whereas your grandmother it's different she likes to talk and i don't think she'd mind both of them to be fair yes and she would like to have had the same degree of i suppose interaction from a conversation point of view but then i suppose that's one of the differences between men and women as well i think it probably didn't help him in the long scheme of things as they're married and as they get closer grandma became more of the spokesperson of the couple which probably led to a less communicative grandpa but with grandma as well especially now that she's on her own she's more isolated we should probably make more of an effort i mean not that we shouldn't have made more of an effort with grandpa but with grandma being on her own i don't want her to be sort of cut off in in sense and you know sometimes if i don’t raise my voice i just don't get listened to and then it turns into usually if i don't raise my voice and then eventually turns into if i never raise my voice i never get heard most of the time when you don't shout we hear you but people do choose to ignore you oh that's even worse so you listen to me then choose not to do things i rarely do that maybe so it’s casually ignoring deliberately ignoring me what's your favorite part about mum your mum - she's just great my best friend and the person i can tell anything to and the person i share a life with so you would tell her that you accidentally killed someone if you accidentally killed someone if i accidentally killed someone i feel as though i might not tell mummy you just said you tell her anything ok yeah ok there's always things that you may not want to share like like what you’re getting her for christmas oh that is a perfect example you don't share what you get people christmas she finds that on christmas day as i haven’t actually killed someone that i am aware of i would not share that with her why did i even ask you that i don't know have you ever killed someone no worst thing i ever did was accidentally throw a rock someone's head in reception i threw a rock at my sister head and she had a little scar above her eyebrow whoops grandma was not happy what did she do to you i got told off but never got any more than told off i was given the “you've dented your sister's head” look yeah you must have a similar look from mummy at times you do that look nearly every day i may use that look quite often… yes what was i saying oh yeah so it was super weird i don't mean weird - it was wonderful to stay there it was just so strange and it was in montreuil so relatively far out and they have this massive house well we called it villa paradou but it was already taken what taken by someone around there yeah yeah twice really yeah paradou is a famous name i know but i didn't realise to that degree are you still going to name the garden paradou maybe yeah we could name the garden 'le paradou' i thought that was the idea because i thought you were going to scape the garden as a paradise sort of thing yeah yeah are you going to remove one of the sofas in the living room then yes but maybe in another dialect oh i thought it was a fictional name i don't know probably it could be a fictional name as well how did you find out that there were another two villas we went to the internet we wanted to register the company and we realised that it was already taken oh and it's taken by a place in czech republic as well - there's quite a lot but surely you can change it slight i mean we could have but if people had looked us up as it is around here it wouldn't have been a good idea oh yeah but i quite like 'villa zola' villa zola and there is a reason because in zola there is paradou there's a bit of a story there that we can use i guess yeah i mean villa zola it kind of rolls of the tongue it's nice well that's good yeah yeah zola - it might be difficult for japanese people they'll say villa 'zora' : steven's family is chinese : who : you know steven my housemate : oh yeah : we were staying at his house in paris : are they chinese : yeah yeah well chinese and vietnamese but steven has always lived in paris or london so he's not really chinese i guess : but the parents speak vietnamese : well the mum is single but the grandparents mostly speak chinese so we got there and it was culturally so strange : i'm sure : they had fish tanks and the grandmother cooks for like three hours and she just feeds you and feeds you : oh gosh but it was amazing yeah lucky you it was so good but yeah the grandmother is essentially there to serve basically she was a really lovely lady chloe and i bought her flowers chloe was there as well yeah - me chloe and steven why didn't you invite chloe and steven here i know i know this is what we were talking about afterwards because i didn't realise i booked paris and them realised lola was coming at the same time as me to nice i thought that it was the perfect time to come however by that time the others had booked to go back to their home countries ahh well next time yeah but we wouldn't have had the space anyways no yeah there's always space yeah always they would have loved to you think yes they'll come next time for sure… but yeah so she just made us eat all the time next time we'll have an extra bedroom as well and in the living room there will be a sofa bed oh really yeah and in yoko's office there is a sofa bed as well oh really no no - no the living room downstairs in the flat oh we're buying a sofa bed a double sofa bed oh yeah with like a hangar attached to it a hangar yeah like a plane hangar kind of thing i don't understand what a hangar is like a hangar - h a n g a r hangar yeah but that's not an english word it is it is really like i found a lot of archived bbc material oh and they've got a huge one attached to their house wow like in paris so basically the grandpa when he came from china he started a bunch of businesses and made some money and bought the house and the hangar he's sort of just hoarded all of it and doesn't want anyone to touch it or to sell it so he just has rows of sewing machines random machines rows of t-shirts of cigarette packets what does he do with all this stuff then nothing nothing but why has he got that because it's just like a bunch of businesses he used to have ah yes yes failed businesses he was the kind of guy that would go to the market and like flip a thousand cigarettes that he bought for a good price you know he owned two restaurants at one point too it's just so ridiculously big and it's two stories he doesn't even want to build on it gosh and steven's mum is thinking that she's sitting on a gold mine and it really annoys her yes definitely they've got millions there and he just doesn't want anyone to touch it how old is he he must be very old i didn't actually meet him he was away actually i'm thinking that because steven's mum is in property it must be so frustrating for her yeah yeah of course but the are is quite up and coming and they've just installed the boris bike equivalent in front of the house which means that they want it to be more connected to the city that's good yeah it is but they're really sitting on millions yeah yeah well his mum will have it soon yeah i guess bit of a harsh way to put it though to develop it but i think it should be flats honestly i should have taken a picture for you there's a huge courtyard in the middle like red carpets and things like that there's no carpets lampoons red lights i mean they have whale skins whale skins yes because when you get get married in china you traditionally get gifted whale skin i didn't know that they also have some kind of shrine with pictures and they put oranges there and they constantly light candles what type of religion are they i'm not sure because steven is not religious so i wouldn't know it's uh buddhist yeah buddhist i'm sure i think so maybe i don't know they have an industrial kitchen as well like metal worktops etc did you have your own bedroom no - steven chloe and i shared a bedroom but we all had pullout beds so it was nice i slept very well anyways where are we going to dinner tomorrow sorry what time is martha coming i don't know but i need to go pick her up at the airport i'll come with you no no you need to work yeah but it will give us some good time to have a conversation oh yeah yeah are you taping this oh that's why you're speaking english no i was just answering you in the same language i thought you were making an effort so the more you speak the better oh ok so the way it works is that so i record this audio and you've done that yourself no no that's way too difficult this exists it's like a paying program it's used by journalists and stuff so i'm sure yoko has used it before in fact she might have a version that i can use oh yes of course and so then it transcribes it to text and then each sentence in the conversation it has to be laid out like a play so the son talks then the father talks then the son talks etc the artificial intelligence that is being built for me will then read it and know when the father is talking and when the son is talking it will then be able to learn and understand what a conversation between and son and father is it needs twenty-thousand sentences to learn however what that's insane well to be honest now that i think of it it goes quite quickly no no no i thought it would but it really doesn't well when you first came here i mean through the door on the very first day firstly what it was is that we wasn't actually warned that you was coming what it was that we was told that the social worker was coming round just to discuss with us about you coming and when i seen you come through the door i looked and i thought well social workers are getting younger and younger and you came up the stairs and it was obviously you and your sister here together and the very first impressions that i got was that your sister was out of her depth and and quite a bit frightened and that you'd sort of step forward as as the as the as the the big brother and you was going to take on this responsibility of coming here and making sure that everything was okay for you and your sister so i'm a bit protective towards your sister i think after a while because it was obviously new to us as well and we were sort of you know trying to feel our way with it and it was just an hour or so after the first meeting and i think after a while you did sort of relax when you maybe i don't know what you thought maybe that that's that was gonna be some sort of prison but obviously it's just a family normal family and i felt that you sort of relaxed then you felt well maybe you know it's not going to be too bad for us after all well i did feel that i mean after the first few first few weeks and first few months obviously we settled and we met the wider family members of yours and angela's family and within a year or so we were like family - i mean i still talk to brendan now he's like a cousin to me i mean we're really close and god with all your daughters i mean god we're both for you too i mean you're like the dad i never had and angela is like a second mom to me so it's like is really the family thing it's not like other people see it like "oh they're outsiders' stick them in a different room or we're not going to talk to them or whatever it's like i know if i need anything i can come to you two and i know that you'll do anything you can to help me because it is like family
