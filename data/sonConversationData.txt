You know I was never as good of a kid as you. I know, youve always mentioned. I think it was different growing up in a smaller city. Probably, growing up in London is a bit of a weird one. In what way?. I dont know, you sort of get used to having so many things and people around you. That makes sense, honestly I was always just looking for something to pass the time. Like what?. So there was this one time where I actually blew the roof off of my house. What? I remember this story vaguely!. What happened was I got this science kit of my birthday. The crappy ones you can buy in a toy shop?. Yes! But what I did was I collected the same chemical over and over again from different pharmacies to get enough to make the explosion enormous. … And you blew the roof off of your house?. well, a hole yes - but my parents were so poor, we lived with a hole in our roof for months. what did your parents say?. they were both so angry, but my parents had a lot of love for me I think, so it was fine in the end. was this in winter?. thankfully not, it did get quite cold though at times. you know I do think back to those times very fondly however, they were good times. Life was more simple, but maybe thats just how it is as a kid no?. yep, I remember everything being so much easier. Remember when I used to wake up and watch cartoons on a saturday and you used to make pancakes?. those were so good!. I remember the smell the most, and the feeling of the warm sun coming through the windows. remember all the plants we used to have?. of course!. it was always important for me to have you grow up around plants. really? Why?. Im not entirely sure, maybe because I had that when I was younger? you know it was always a struggle for me to accept that you were growing up in a big city like London, with so much at your disposal, including a middle class family. like, I had nothing, and you had everything handed to you. I feel as though it was such an integral part of my education to have to fend for myself. yes I know, but honestly I feel as though you just assumed I had to learn that stuff at way too young of an age. what do you mean?. well its just I remember when you used to force me to go out and get stuff from the shops when it was dark, or getting something from your motorbike when I was really young. It was scary. Yeah I know, probably not the best move. Like I know that you wanted me to be more ‘streetwise but honestly I was like ten years old, Im sure it would have come more naturally. I know, Im sorry … I do think about these things a lot. I really just didnt know sometimes. its ok, honestly Im really way over it now. Im glad. what was your father like to you?. I loved him so much, it was so difficult when I was growing up as I said, we have nothing. My dad tried and tried to make our life better but it was difficult sometimes. In what sense?. Well, we never really got the holidays you get now, the food, etc … . Yes, but having all this doesnt make me love you more or less? Surely it would be the same with you and your dad?. Oh yes, completely. I think I even loved him more, or love him more now because I understand the effort he put into making our life better. He was a communist wasnt he?. Yes, and I was part of the communist party for a while too, we all grew up as a very socialist family, giving everything we had, even if we needed it. This is something thats lacking today I think. Your grandpa used to bring home homeless people all the time, it used to drive your grandma insane!. why?. to be honest, you know how caring and giving I am to others, honestly Im too trustworthy a lot of the time, but Im sort of on your grandmas side for this one. There was this one incident … . an incident?. Yeah, so basically grandpa brought this homeless guy home to sleep in our house. Now bare in mind that we basically didnt even have space for your uncle and I. Yeah … . anyways so we wake up and this guy is gone. Nothing unusual, hes spent the night and thats that right?. Yep. Well, we go into the bathroom and the guy literally smeared shit all over the walls. Poor grandpa had to clean it all up … . Oh man … yeah thats rough, Im not sure I would have had the courage to clean that up. Trust me, with the wrath of your grandma, he had to have the courage. its sad, you know I never really knew grandpa, but yet I still sort of miss him quite a bit, from time to time. well, he was there when you were younger and my god did he love you and your sister. I know, I remember a few things. Like what?. Well, that she smoked cigarettes, so as I was young and impressionable I saw that as this horrible this and it stressed me out for months thinking she was going to die. Oh yeah, those were some really good holidays. anyways he would come and visit us sometimes, and bring Lola and I presents and I remember being this snotty stupid kid and never appreciating his gifts. What do you mean?. Well, I mean I would smile and say thank you and be all nice, but inside I would just really remember thinking that they were shit gifts. Like colouring books and pencils etc. Yes, but he was always so out of touch with you guys and literally had no money to spend on you. I know! I know, honestly I have cried about this now. I see how beautiful of a gesture it was now and how amazing of a man he was. He really was … . I now wear the gold chain that he gifted me once. Wait he gifted you a gold chain?. yeah!. Lucas, do you realise that he probably spent all of what he had for a month on that?. I do, you have no idea, this is the kind of stuff that makes me wish I had had more time to get to know him. Yes, I mean thats my fault too. Anyways, so he gifted me this thin gold chain with a guitar pendant on it and I recently found it again about a year ago and I never take it off!. No way, yeah I remember seeing that around your neck and taking the piss because you look like a gangster. Well its grandpas! I took off the guitar pendant and it never comes off of my neck. Thats really sweet, I bet that he would be so happy to hear that. I hope, honestly I regret a lot of things when it comes to him. Do you remember when Lola and I bought him his new dog?. Oh yes! Well I wasnt there but I certainly remember the story. He cried didnt he?. Yes, I mean he was always quite an emotional man, I really respected that in him. Yeah, I think the older I get, the more I respect people that can tap into their emotions. I think were both getting better at that. Yeah definitely. Did you do it yet?. Do what?. You know what Im talking—. In a minute, okay?. No, son. Now. Please. Why does it have to be this moment?. Because I … . Nope. You cant! Remember?. Wait … What? Remember what?. Probably like … ten years ago. I remember! You sat me down one night. I was probably like seven or ten or something. That math tutor sure was worth it. You said, “Ahem, well, uh … listen son. I want to do things differently … If you ever hear me begin to say ‘Because I said so you gotta just slap me and remind me how much I hated hearing it growing up. ”. That voice … that was supposed to be what I sound like?. Seriously though. I am serious. I need you to do it … now. Soon. Your mother will be here any time. And thats my problem because … . Cmon, man. I cant do this right now. Youre almost a grown man. Its time to start taking … . Care of myself. Yeah. I get it. You and Mom are ready for me to be out. Well, youve already finished one year of coll–. Save it, Dad! I know!. Whoa! Whats with that shit?. Ill do it! I mean … Jesus! Why does it matter so much?. It just does. I guess youll … . Oh shit … lemme guess. understand better when Im a father?. I, uh. wasnt going to say that. Right. Okay, fine. Just … please do it. Like I said, shell be here soon. Have you always been afraid of her?. What did you just say?. I said, ‘Have you always been afraid of her?. What the fuck, man?. Touch a nerve?. Im about to … . Hey!. College is changing you, son. In ways I didnt expect. Wait. Come back. Dad!. What. I m sorry. That was … out of line, I guess. Oh, you guess?. It was. Im sorry. Im … sorry too. What do you have to be sorry fo?. I deserved it. No. You really didnt. Not now. Defnitely not when you were younger. Id … actually disagree. It made me who I am. But you gotta understand, son. Its not something dads want at the top of their parenting resume. Whats the big deal? You spanked your kids when they acted up. Who doesnt do that?. Well, your mother for one. I meant dads. Well … mine didnt. But he wasnt in your life. Uh-huh. Okay. Heres my thing. I mean, kids are going to test you. Shit, Dad. I just did not two seconds ago. At least when theyre a certain age, you gotta set ‘em straight, right?. Can I sit on that thing?. What, the bookshelf?. No. That?. Oh. Sure. Lemme just … . here ya go. Thanks. Huh. More comfy than I woulda imagined. We got it worn in this past year, my roommate and I. Id say so. Wait. What?. Um … did you, ya know … with anyone on this?. Um … . Ill get a chair. Sorry, Dad. Its fine. Glad I asked, at least. Why dont we just go get some coffee. Thatd be nice … except you didnt do what I came in here for in the first place. Shit. Okay. Im willing to do it. Thats remarkable. Okay, okay. I get it. Do you?. Ha! Not really. But I feel guilty now. You know … your back, or whatever. Just dont be in a rush to get older, son. You kiddin? Im never gettin old. Dont let your mother hear you say that. Ugh … she takes everything I say the wrong way. son … shes a mother. She just cares. I know, Dad. I know. But Ill bet she only tells you part of the story. Are you suggesting that your mother would not be completely open with me?. What? Whats that mean?. I was just being a dick. Ha!. Okay. Im gonna get a chair. Id prefer not to sit on that bed … for obvious reasons. In the meantime, please do it. Begin it. Do something to exhibit you heard her earlier and want to make her happy. She likes that. Being happy?. You know what I mean. Okay … . Dad! Dont!!. Whyd that happen?. I forgot those were there. You couldnt even finish it?. Shit. I forgot I put it down last night. Now were both in it. Shes going to get here any second and well be sopping up warm beer off that new carpet. Shit. Dammit! It was one of the imports too!. Yeah. Lemme get some cleaning stuff. Didnt know you liked those fancy beers. I splurge from time to time. Didnt know you thought it was okay to drink in this house. You forget youre only nineteen?. No. Thats impossible. Well, now were both in it. The rooms not clean. Theres beer on that new carpet. Shes going to be triple-pissed. So much for a fun weekend. Dad! Relax!. Shit!. Whats wrong?. Oh, no!!. Is it your back?. Yeah, son! Im a grown man crouched on the fucking floor!. What can I do?. Oh my god! Goddammit!. Dad! Relax!. Shut up!. I mean, dont let it tense up! Here … sort of fall into this beanbag. But you … . Just do it, Dad!. I dont want to think about whats rubbed up against this fucking thing!. Then dont!. Shed better have been worth it is all Im saying. This is torture. Do you have any … pills or anything you need?. In my … I mean … wait. Lemme think. I uh. put them … . Dad! Think! Where were you the last time you took them?. Yelling at me isnt going to speed up my memory!. Okay! Im sorry! Ive just never seen you … . Nightstand. What?. For Gods sake … I took them a couple nights ago right before I went to sleep. They must be next to my bed. Okay. Just … breathe … . Im not having a baby, son. I mean … relax. Ill be right back. Check around the floor if they arent on there!. Dad?. Did you find them?. Sort of. What? Jesus. Either you did or you didnt. Well, you were right. They were next to your bed. Gimme two. And some water from your bathroom will be fine. The bottles empty. What?!. All I found was the empty bottle. How can that be? I just filled it … . lemme see … when did we go … . It says a refill is allowed but with doctors approval. Shit. Its Saturday. So it cant be filled until Monday?. Fuck it. Ill just lay here face down in … . ugh … whatevers been on this beanbag until Monday. Wait! I hear Mom. Were both fucked now. What does that mean?. I was kidding. Go get the door for her. Hey, mom! Is that dads prescription? When did you get that purse?. How are you, son?. Im OK. Did you hear from Law School?. Yes. I called you, remember?. Yes. Congratulations. Youll be on the Supreme Court. I may just chase ambulances. Fine. Hows Raymond?. Hes fine. Got into OCS. Army? Thats good. Thats bad. You havent mentioned Jennifer. What is there to say?. But what did you think?. Shes absolutely charming. With her background, to get to Radcliffe is. Get to the point! - It doesnt concern her, but you. Your rebellion. And you are rebelling. I fail. I fail to see how marrying a brilliant Radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion. Shes not some crazy hippie. Shes not many things. What irks you most, that shes Catholic or poor?. What attracts you most?. Im leaving. Dont go off half-cocked. I would only ask that you wait a bit. Define "bit". Finish Law School. If its real, itll stand the test of time. It is real, but why should I put it through a test?. Im asking you. Youre commanding me!. If you marry her now, Ill not give you the time of day. Father, you dont know the time of day!. You know, Im really glad that youre cycling now instead of taking the tube. Not only is it cheaper but youre getting your exercise in!. Yes I know … Youve always said this to me, Im really glad as its saving me money but I dont think Ill ever really get into cycling as a sport that I want to do. I know, youve never really been interested have you?. Not at all, I think its because it was such a big part of my life when I was younger because of you that I just got bored of it eventually. I know, thats sort of my fault. Its fine, I mean it was fun for a while, but eventually I just wanted to stay home and watch cartoons you know?. I know, Im sorry, I feel as though a lot of the stuff I did when you were younger was selfish. No it wasnt, I mean you couldnt have known?. It was easier when your sister was born because I already knew what I was doing to a certain extent. Yes, but for me it got harder with you, especially after the divorce really … . How?. Well everything changed and it became very difficult to deal with everything. I mean I felt like I had to suddenly grow up. It wasnt fair. I know, I think Ive always known but I never really talked to you about it. Its ok, its in the past now, but honestly it was really difficult. It was a difficult time for me too, your mum leaving me wasnt fun in any way. I know that but I was so young and I didnt really know what was happening. I know Im sorry. And I didnt know how to react, who to trust, what to do … . What do you mean who to trust?. Well, I felt like you guys were creating sides in a sense, like as if I had to pick one. I never really felt that way. Really? Are you sure? Because you used to tell me some stuff about mum which was clearly untrue and then I would side with you for a while. It really fucked with my head. Look, I was in a bad place ok? Im sorry. Yes I know, I guess Im just brining this up because were having this conversation now but Im not holding any grudges really. Are you sure?. Yeah I think so, I mean I cant really know whats going on, deep down in my subconscious but I really dont think I ever see you badly really. Im really thankful for that. Yeah, well I mean you still piss me off sometimes. And you still piss me off sometimes!. Do you remember when we used to get into those crazy arguments when I was younger?. I do, when you were about 16?. Yeah damn, we really didnt get along around that time. Yeah I guess thats because you were my first experience with raising a teenager. I have thicker skin with your sister now. No dad, I also think its because we have clashing personalities. Oh really, in what way?. Well, I mean clashing and similar at the same time actually?. What your obsessive nature?. Yeah my obsessive nature, the way I obsess over everything. How everything needs to be my way, or I sort of internally freak out. I know what I want basically. I also feel like I have slight OCD from you honestly. I dont have OCD?. Oh man, yes you do. Cleaning the floor twice a day and hoovering at 8am? Thats obsessive compulsive. I just like keeping the house clean. I know you do, and I commend that. Its taught me to do the same with my place now, but my god it would bother me when I was younger. I know. Like for example the way youd go nuts if we walked on the floor with our bare feet?. Yeah. I mean it was literally our house, I needed to wear slippers everywhere. That floor was special though, it was some kind of weird white resin that got dirty super fast. Yeah but anyways I dont think it was just that, I think that a lot of my childhood consisted of just listening to you with my tail between my legs and when I hit sixteen I kind of just wanted to do my own thing. Like any sixteen year old. Yes I know but I mean thats why we clashed so much, I just didnt accept most of what you said or wanted me to do anymore. I remember. Just silly stuff, I think I started rebelling against that and just getting angry in general … Like those damn vegetables. You never liked your vegetables Lucas, come on … . I did, I dont know what that obsession was with you that I didnt. What?. Its almost as if you felt like you wanted to find something that bothered you about me. No not at all, I mean I just wanted the best for your health. Yes but I very clearly ate all the vegetables that were on my plate. Well, what about salad huh?. You know that I just never liked salad, its that simple. Or tomatoes?. Yes ok fine, or tomatoes, but I felt like you would literally make those things so that I would not eat them and then you could complain. oh come on, I was never that petty. Fine, but thats how I felt. Honestly I was just scared for your health, thats all. But see! Thats what I mean … I probably ate better than most kids, but you needed me to eat everything otherwise it pissed you off … Its like the thing with the damn phones!. The phones?. Yeah the phones, you got obsessed with the idea that I was constantly on my phone. But again … you were constantly on your phone werent you?. No, I mean sure I was on it a decent amount. Yeah you were. Yeah, but look it was the age I think. It all started with that damn iPod touch that everyone wanted at your age. Oh yeah! Do you remember how much I wanted that thing?. Definitely, Diego got one first didnt he?. Yep, I was so damn jealous … . But I got you one for christmas that year!. You did, it was such an amazing gift. I remember playing on it for hours. Thats when you started spending so much time on your devices!. Yes, but it was a whole new world for me. To be able to download any games was amazing. I never really understood that. Understood what?. The whole gaming thing. What do you mean?. What was so attractive about gaming on a small screen?. I dont know, to be honest I was never allowed a console from you and mum so it was basically my first console. Thats true! You never got that Nintendo DS that you wanted so badly. Oh man, I never wanted something more in my life … I wanted it more than that tiger toy I ask for Christmas when we were on holiday. Your mum would have been so angry at me if I would have bought you a Nintendo DS. I know. I clearly remember looking at them in shops and imagining all the things I could do and how I could try and buy myself one. Thats cute, I remember wanting things like that as a kid too. Like what?. Well there was bicycle that I wanted more than anything when I was a kid. Thats such a pre-naughties present to want. It really is, no one asks for bicycles anymore. I mean I would definitely want a new bike now. Sure, but when you were a kid all you wanted was mario kart or whatever. True. Anyways, what I was trying to say was that I was obsessed with my phone for a while, because it was so exciting to me when I first got one. I know. Yes, but then that interest died off after a year and you kept pestering my every single time I got a text. Well yes, because you would literally get a text every single second of the day. See, thats not true. I would get a text and even if I didnt look at it you would get annoyed that I got that text for some reason. Ok, maybe we were a bit overbearing with all that technology stuff. I do remember however the first ipod you and mum got me!. Really?. Yes it was this tiny one and it was for my birthday. You told me you had a surprise and we took the bus to this shopping centre where you let me pick one out. Oh yes, of course - I remember that! You were so damn happy. I really was, especially because I was only starting to get into music back then and it was the new cool thing to do. What have an ipod?. Yeah, I guess, but like collect music, be an angsty rock kid etc. I remember that stage, your damn black skinny jeans. Not too sure what was going on there in that phase of my life. I remember you saying that youd never wear anything else than black skinny jeans. I truly believed that though. Well look at you now! No skinny jeans … . Thank goodness for that huh?. But I clearly remember really wanting to be angsty and grunge, when truthfully that just wasnt me. Every kid goes through that, yours wasnt too bad. Did you go through that?. Im not too sure, I mean I remember wanting to be like my brother but Im not too sure if there was a certain ‘group I wanted to belong to. Im not sure if I was trying to belong to a certain group, I think my friends did and I just wanted to be like them I guess. Which friends?. Like PJ and Max. They were so into their music, they loved playing guitar etc. Oh yeah, that was about the time where you had asked for a guitar and I got you one but you never played it, not even once?. Sounds about right … . It was such a beautiful electric guitar too. Did you ever even take a lesson?. I dont think so. Such a shame!. I know, I do regret it. You were never too good at the cello though. Thats true, but I really hated it, plus I was forced to play it at school. I think you were too young to appreciate it. Probably yes. I do also regret not getting into skateboarding really. No you were good! I remember. Thats not true, thats just the father in you talking. I couldnt do any tricks!. We got you some lessons though?. Yes, but I dont know, its just one of those hundreds of things I thought I would love doing and then ended up getting bored of … . You never got bored of your computer though!. Yes I know … I was a bit of a geeky kid, literally the opposite of you. No! I didnt mean it like that, Im so proud of you. You always help me with my computer and youre all self taught!. I mean yes, but most people of my generation know how to use a computer correctly. I know, but Im still proud of you. Thanks dad. Often wed sit and have nothing to discuss and its only actually after hes passed away that I then think of those points that Id like to question him about or perhaps discuss with him. Im not that good at small talk. Well I find that in certain social situations and I think youve observed it particularly when Im among other Nigerians. Then I suppose a different part of my character emerges that is actually looking back to a time in my life when --. From your school period?. Yeah and I wouldnt normally talk about things like I suppose experiences … . With grandpa is there stuff that you wish you spoke to to him about then?. Yes quite a lot. At the time I wouldnt really know what to talk about. I was just surprised to hear you say that there was stuff you needed to talk about, you know? because in my opinion it was quite hard to try and get conversation from him. I mean its interesting that you say that as well that it was it was difficult to get him to. to converse. Yeah. And if you actually got him on a subject that he enjoyed then he would talk at length on other things he wouldnt talk very much. So whereas your grandmother its different. She likes to talk and I dont think shed mind. Both of them to be fair. Yes and she would like to have had the same degree of I suppose interaction from a conversation point of view but then I suppose thats one of the differences between men and women as well. I think it probably didnt help him in the long scheme of things as theyre married and as they get closer, Grandma became more of the spokesperson of the couple which probably led to a less communicative grandpa, but with grandma as well especially now that shes on her own shes more isolated. We should probably make more of an effort. I mean not that we shouldnt have made more of an effort with grandpa but with grandma being on her own I dont want her to be sort of cut off in in sense. And you know sometimes if I dont raise my voice, I just dont get listened to. And then it turns into usually if I dont raise my voice and then eventually turns into if I never raise my voice I never get heard. Most of the time when you dont shout, we hear you but people do choose to ignore you. Oh thats even worse. So you listen to me then choose not to do things. I rarely do that. Maybe. So its casually ignoring, deliberately ignoring me. Whats your favorite part about mum. Your mum - shes just great. My best friend and the person I can tell anything to and the person I share a life with. So, you would tell her that you accidentally killed someone if you accidentally killed someone?. If I accidentally killed someone, I feel as though I might not tell mummy. You just said you tell her anything. OK. Yeah. OK. Theres always things that you may not want to share like. Like what youre getting her for Christmas?. Oh that is a perfect example. You dont share what you get people Christmas. She finds that on Christmas Day. As I havent actually killed someone, that I am aware of, I would not share that with her. Why did I even ask you that?. I dont know. Have you ever killed someone?. No. Worst thing I ever did was accidentally throw a rock someones head in reception. I threw a rock at my sister head and she had a little scar above her eyebrow. Whoops. Grandma was not happy. What did she do to you?. I got told off but never got any more than told off. I was given the “youve dented your sisters head” look. Yeah. You must have a similar look from mummy at times. You do that look nearly every day. I may use that look quite often … . Yes. What was I saying? Oh yeah so it was super weird, I dont mean weird - it was wonderful to stay there, it was just so strange and it was in Montreuil, so relatively far out. and they have this massive house!. Well we called it Villa Paradou, but it was already taken. What taken by someone around there?. Yeah, yeah. twice!. Really?. Yeah. Paradou is a famous name. I know but I didnt realise to that degree. Are you still going to name the garden Paradou?. Maybe yeah. We could name the garden Le Paradou. I thought that was the idea, because I thought you were going to scape the garden as a paradise sort of thing. Yeah yeah. Are you going to remove one of the sofas in the living room then?. Yes, but maybe in another dialect. Oh I thought it was a fictional name. I dont know, probably. It could be a fictional name as well. How did you find out that there were another two villas?. We went to the internet, we wanted to register the company and we realised that it was already taken. Oh. And its taken by a place in Czech Republic as well - theres quite a lot. But surely you can change it slight?. I mean we could have but if people had looked us up, as it is around here it wouldnt have been a good idea. Oh yeah. But I quite like Villa Zola. Villa Zola. And there is a reason, because in Zola there is Paradou. Theres a bit of a story there that we can use. I guess yeah. I mean Villa Zola, it kind of rolls of the tongue, its nice. Well thats good!. Yeah yeah. Zola - It might be difficult for Japanese people, theyll say Villa Zora. : Stevens family is Chinese. : Who?. : You know, Steven my housemate. : Oh yeah. : We were staying at his house in Paris. : Are they Chinese?. : Yeah yeah, well Chinese and Vietnamese, but Steven has always lived in Paris or London, so hes not really Chinese I guess. : But the parents speak Vietnamese?. : Well the mum is single but the grandparents mostly speak Chinese. So we got there and it was culturally so strange. : Im sure. : They had fish tanks and the grandmother cooks for like three hours and she just feeds you and feeds you. : Oh gosh. But it was amazing. Yeah? Lucky you!. It was so good, but yeah the grandmother is essentially there to serve basically, she was a really lovely lady, Chloe and I bought her flowers. Chloe was there as well?. Yeah - me, Chloe and Steven. Why didnt you invite Chloe and Steven here?. I know I know! This is what we were talking about afterwards, because I didnt realise. I booked Paris and them realised Lola was coming at the same time as me to Nice. I thought that it was the perfect time to come. However by that time the others had booked to go back to their home countries. Ahh well, next time?. Yeah! But we wouldnt have had the space anyways, no?. Yeah, theres always space!. Yeah?. Always!. They would have loved to!. You think?. Yes, theyll come next time for sure … but yeah, so she just made us eat all the time. Next time well have an extra bedroom as well and in the living room there will be a sofa bed. Oh really?. Yeah and in Yokos office there is a sofa bed as well. Oh really?. No, no - no the living room downstairs, in the flat. Oh. Were buying a sofa bed. A double sofa bed?. Oh yeah?. With like a hangar attached to it. A hangar?. Yeah like a plane hangar, kind of thing. I dont understand what a hangar is. Like a hangar - h, a, n, g, a, r. Hangar!. Yeah. But thats not an English word?. It is, it is. Really?. Like I found a lot of archived BBC material. Oh!. And theyve got a huge one attached to their house. Wow. Like in Paris! So basically the grandpa, when he came from China, he started a bunch of businesses and made some money and bought the house and the hangar. Hes sort of just hoarded all of it and doesnt want anyone to touch it or to sell it. So he just has rows of sewing machines, random machines, rows of t-shirts, of cigarette packets. What does he do with all this stuff then?. Nothing! Nothing!. But why has he got that?. Because its just like, a bunch of businesses he used to have. Ah yes yes. Failed businesses. He was the kind of guy that would go to the market and like flip a thousand cigarettes that he bought for a good price you know? He owned two restaurants at one point too. Its just so ridiculously big and its two stories! He doesnt even want to build on it. Gosh. And Stevens mum is thinking that shes sitting on a gold mine and it really annoys her. Yes definitely. Theyve got millions there! And he just doesnt want anyone to touch it. How old is he?. He must be very old. I didnt actually meet him, he was away actually. Im thinking that because Stevens mum is in property, it must be so frustrating for her. Yeah yeah of course. But the are is quite up and coming and theyve just installed the Boris bike equivalent in front of the house, which means that they want it to be more connected to the city. Thats good!. Yeah it is, but theyre really sitting on millions. Yeah, yeah. Well, his mum will have it soon. Yeah I guess, bit of a harsh way to put it though. To develop it!. But I think it should be flats honestly. I should have taken a picture for you. Theres a huge courtyard in the middle. And their house is very Chinese?. Very. Like red carpets and things like that?. Theres no carpets. Lampoons, red lights?. I mean they have whale skins. Whale skins?. Yes, because when you get get married in China, you traditionally get gifted whale skin. I didnt know that!. They also have some kind of shrine with pictures and they put oranges there and they constantly light candles. What type of religion are they?. Im not sure because Steven is not religious so I wouldnt know. Its uh. Buddhist?. Yeah Buddhist Im sure. I think so, maybe, I dont know. They have an industrial kitchen as well! Like metal worktops etc. Did you have your own bedroom?. No - Steven, Chloe and I shared a bedroom, but we all had pullout beds so it was nice. I slept very well. Anyways where are we going to dinner tomorrow?. Sorry?. What time is Martha coming?. I dont know but I need to go pick her up at the airport. Ill come with you. No, no. You need to work. Yeah but it will give us some good time to have a conversation. Oh yeah, yeah, are you taping this?. Oh thats why youre speaking English. No, I was just answering you in the same language. I thought you were making an effort. So the more you speak the better. Oh ok. So the way it works is that, so I record this audio. yeah?. and then I have a program that transcribes it to text, so it will be able to tell who you are and who I am. and youve done that yourself?. No, no, thats way too difficult. This exists, its like a paying program. Its used by journalists and stuff. So Im sure Yoko has used it before. In fact she might have a version that I can use. Oh yes, of course. And so, then it transcribes it to text and then each sentence in the conversation it has to be laid out like a play. So, the son talks, then the father talks, then the son talks, etc. The artificial intelligence that is being built for me will then read it and know when the father is talking and when the son is talking. It will then be able to learn and understand what a conversation between and son and father is. It needs twenty-thousand sentences to learn however. What?! Thats insane! Well, to be honest now that I think of it, it goes quite quickly no?. No, No. I thought it would but it really doesnt. Well when you first came here I mean through the door on the very first day, firstly, what it was is that we wasnt actually warned that you was coming. What it was that we was told that the social worker was coming round just to discuss with us about you coming and when I seen you come through the door I looked and I thought Well social workers are getting younger and younger. And you came up the stairs and it was obviously you and your sister here together and the very first impressions that I got was that your sister was out of her depth and and quite a bit frightened and that youd sort of step forward as as the as the as the the big brother. And you was going to take on this responsibility of coming here and making sure that everything was okay for you and your sister. So Im a bit protective towards your sister. I think after a while because it was obviously new to us as well and we were sort of you know trying to feel our way with it and it was just an hour or so after the first meeting. And I think after a while you did sort of relax when you maybe I dont know what you thought maybe that thats that was gonna be some sort of prison but obviously its just a family. Normal family and I felt that you sort of relaxed then you felt well maybe you know its not going to be too bad for us after all. Well I did feel that I mean after the first few first few weeks and first few months obviously we settled and we met the wider family members of yours and Angelas family and within a year or so we were like family - I mean I still talk to Brendan Now hes like a cousin to me I mean were really close and God with all your daughters I mean God were both for you too I mean youre like the dad I never had and Angela is like a second mom to me so its like is really the family thing its not like other people see it like "oh theyre outsiders, stick them in a different room or were not going to talk to them or whatever. Its like I know if I need anything I can come to you two and I know that youll do anything you can to help me because it is like family. Well after the first interview that you. Well interview is not really the right word to use but the first meeting that we had. And you went back and obviously spoke to the social worker because youd still got a choice about it then and obviously you chose to come here and give it a go. I mean what I mean Angela was acutely aware of that it must be extremely difficult you know to move away from everything that you knew up to that date in your life really. Your family and it was your mother And to move away and coming to a different environment, a different location and another family really. We sort of tried really to put you at ease to make you feel at home to the best of our ability you know, but that road had its ups and downs with it and you cant do that overnight because it is, well I felt it was sort of difficult to sort of adjust to a different family a different location. So really we sort of started to go down that road towards making you as you know as comfortable and as happy as possible. I mean it wasnt always easy because you know you were leaving your mom and youve got a strong relationship with your mom. Well, didnt. Well you know your mom had got to a point that she couldnt cope anymore and what happened was, I mean because mom became part of the family as well didnt she. Yeah. You know I mean your mom used to come here and I think that that was everybody didnt look on it as you. your mom didnt look at it as though somebody else were taking over her children. She looked at that it in the way that she knew she couldnt cope. But she also would checked out where you were and was making sure that you were okay and because of the work together with your mom and with us and that that also made you feel comfortable because you didnt have to make any choices between your mum or us. It was more than enhancing what youve already got and whats the state now is that youre close to your mum, to us and nobody feels threatened in any way as to who you know well sometimes when kids come into care they have to make a choice and its very difficult for them because they are born with parents but the parents dont like that that bonding. So theyll try and disrupt it, but Marks mum didnt do that. And I think that helped an awful lot. At what stage were you at when you arrived here?. Well it was kind of like I didnt really have, well I kind of had a relationship with my mum. But, it wasnt that strong and I was kind of in a place where I resented my mum for all the moves and all the things that happened and I was angry at everyone for really my own reasons. I mean my anger was tied to my mom but really I directed it everywhere. I wasnt channeling it because there was just too much channel. And going back on that it was kind of like everything that was familiar to me was the anger, the pain and the stress and then coming here and the pain and the stress were gone really quickly I mean, the anger stayed. I mean obviously we worked through that over the last couple years but other than that a lot of things calmed down and actually I did get a stronger relationship with my mom because of you and Angela and it was like having that stability there to help me to do that which you provided. Mm hmm. Well thats what thats what we realised when you came here I mean that your mom had cared for you up to this stage, however there were some issues there back in the past which is the reason that you came into care but in a sense your mom was a sort of victim for many reasons and that we really felt that we needed to bring your mother in to keep her into the relationship that you got with me and Angela and keep your family together. And she she came in and she got on really well with Angela. I mean she got on with you as well I mean when we went for contact it wasnt just like "there you go the kids" or "theres the budget" or whatever it was like "how is everything going" "how are things with you?" - it was a conversation it wasnt just like two people just given the kids over giving whatever over, it was like a little conversation and it was just like dropping us off to see a family member it was like dropping us off to go see a nan or something. Well really it was my mum, but other than that it was just so easy. I mean I feel that she didnt desert you in any way shape or form. I mean I think that she did what she felt was best for you at that time which must have been very very difficult for her very difficult and she sort of worked with us as an extended family group and kept contact with you both, you and your sister and she sort of gave permission really for you to attach to us. She didnt make it difficult for us and that helped us to no end. And its its helped you as well I think. It helped you helped me in a way because if she had been there, kind of saying conflicting things I would have been conflicted I would have been kind of confused but she was well every time we were talking about you and Angela too or when we went see her she was joining the conversation. She was actually saying to us "Im so glad I made that decision because you got things now and youre doing things now that I could never have given you youve, got the chance to do things that you really wanted to do, things that you dreamed about doing and staying with me you would have never been able to do" so with that she was the one saying to us "its the best decision that we could have made for you".
