you know i was never as good of a kid as youi know, you’ve always mentionedi think it was different growing up in a smaller cityprobably, growing up in london is a bit of a weird onein what way?i don’t know, you sort of get used to having so many things and people around youthat makes sense, honestly i was always just looking for something to pass the timelike what?so there was this one time where i actually blew the roof off of my housewhat? i remember this story vaguely!what happened was i got this science kit of my birthdaythe crappy ones you can buy in a toy shop?yes! but what i did was i collected the same chemical over and over again from different pharmacies to get enough to make the explosion enormous… and you blew the roof off of your house?well, a hole yes - but my parents were so poor, we lived with a hole in our roof for monthswhat did your parents say?they were both so angry, but my parents had a lot of love for me i think, so it was fine in the endwas this in winter?thankfully not, it did get quite cold though at times you know i do think back to those times very fondly however, they were good times. life was more simple, but maybe that’s just how it is as a kid no?yep, i remember everything being so much easier. remember when i used to wake up and watch cartoons on a saturday and you used to make pancakes?those were so good!i remember the smell the most, and the feeling of the warm sun coming through the windowsremember all the plants we used to have?of course!it was always important for me to have you grow up around plantsreally? why?i’m not entirely sure, maybe because i had that when i was younger? you know it was always a struggle for me to accept that you were growing up in a big city like london, with so much at your disposal, including a middle class family ike, i had nothing, and you had everything handed to you. i feel as though it was such an integral part of my education to have to fend for myselfyes i know, but honestly i feel as though you just assumed i had to learn that stuff at way too young of an agewhat do you mean?well, i mean i would smile and say thank you and be all nice, but inside i would just really remember thinking that they were shit gifts. like colouring books and pencils etcyeah i know, probably not the best movelike i know that you wanted me to be more ‘streetwise’ but honestly i was like ten years old, i’m sure it would have come more naturally.i know, i’m sorry… i do think about these things a lot. i really just didn’t know sometimesit’s ok, honestly i’m really way over it nowi’m gladwhat was your father like to you?i loved him so much, it was so difficult when i was growing up as i said, we have nothing. my dad tried and tried to make our life better but it was difficult sometimes.in what sense?well, we never really got the holidays you get now, the food, etc…yes, but having all this doesn’t make me love you more or less? surely it would be the same with you and your dad?oh yes, completely. i think i even loved him more, or love him more now because i understand the effort he put into making our life better.he was a communist wasn’t he?yes, and i was part of the communist party for a while too, we all grew up as a very socialist family, giving everything we had, even if we needed it. this is something that’s lacking today i think. your grandpa used to bring home homeless people all the time, it used to drive your grandma insane!why?to be honest, you know how caring and giving i am to others, honestly i’m too trustworthy a lot of the time, but i’m sort of on your grandma’s side for this one. there was this one incident…an incident?yeah, so basically grandpa brought this homeless guy home to sleep in our house. now bare in mind that we basically didn’t even have space for your uncle and iyeah…anyways so we wake up and this guy is gone. nothing unusual, he’s spent the night and that’s that right?yepwell, we go into the bathroom and the guy literally smeared shit all over the walls. poor grandpa had to clean it all up…oh man… yeah that’s rough, i’m not sure i would have had the courage to clean that uptrust me, with the wrath of your grandma, he had to have the courageit’s sad, you know i never really knew grandpa, but yet i still sort of miss him quite a bit, from time to timewell, he was there when you were younger and my god did he love you and your sisteri know, i remember a few things.like what?well, that she smoked cigarettes, so as i was young and impressionable i saw that as this horrible this and it stressed me out for months thinking she was going to dieoh yeah, those were some really good holidaysanyways he would come and visit us sometimes, and bring lola and i presents and i remember being this snotty stupid kid and never appreciating his giftsyes, but he was always so out of touch with you guys and literally had no money to spend on youi know! i know, honestly i have cried about this now. i see how beautiful of a gesture it was now and how amazing of a man he was.he really was…i now wear the gold chain that he gifted me oncewait he gifted you a gold chain?yeah!lucas, do you realise that he probably spent all of what he had for a month on that?i do, you have no idea, this is the kind of stuff that makes me wish i had had more time to get to know himyes, i mean that’s my fault tooanyways, so he gifted me this thin gold chain with a guitar pendant on it and i recently found it again about a year ago and i never take it off!no way, yeah i remember seeing that around your neck and taking the piss because you look like a gangsterwell it’s grandpas! i took off the guitar pendant and it never comes off of my neckthat’s really sweet, i bet that he would be so happy to hear thati hope, honestly i regret a lot of things when it comes to him.do you remember when lola and i bought him his new dog?h yes! well i wasn’t there but i certainly remember the story. he cried didn’t he?yes, i mean he was always quite an emotional man, i really respected that in himyeah, i think the older i get, the more i respect people that can tap into their emotionsi think we’re both getting better at thatyeah definitelyid you do it yet?o what?ou know what i’m talking—n a minute, okay?o, son. now. please.hy does it have to be this moment?ecause i…ope. you can’t! remember?ait…what? remember

charming.with her background, to get to radcliffe is...get to the point! - it doesn't concern her, but you.your rebellion. and you are rebelling.i fail...i fail to see how marrying a brilliant radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion.she's not some crazy hippie.she's not many things.what irks you most, that she's catholic or poor?what attracts you most?i'm leaving.don't go off half-cocked. i would only ask that you wait a bit.define "bit".finish law school. if it's real, it'll stand the test of time.it is real, but why should i put it through a test?i'm asking you.you're commanding me!if you marry her now, i'll not give you the time of day.father, you don't know the time of day!you know, i’m really glad that you’re cycling now instead of taking the tube. not only is it cheaper but you’re getting your exercise in!yes i know… you’ve always said this to me, i’m really glad as it’s saving me money but i don’t think i’ll ever really get into cycling as a sport that i want to doi know, you’ve never really been interested have you?not at all, i think it’s because it was such a big part of my life when i was younger because of you that i just got bored of it eventuallyi know, that’s sort of my fault.it’s fine, i mean it was fun for a while, but eventually i just wanted to stay home and watch cartoons you know?i know, i’m sorry, i feel as though a lot of the stuff i did when you were younger was selfishno it wasn’t, i mean you couldn’t have known?it was easier when your sister was born because i already knew what i was doing to a certain extentyes, but for me it got harder with you, especially after the divorce really…how?well everything changed and it became very difficult to deal with everything. i mean i felt like i had to suddenly grow up. it wasn’t fairi know, i think i’ve always known but i never really talked to you about itit’s ok, it’s in the past now, but honestly it was really difficult.it was a difficult time for me too, your mum leaving me wasn’t fun in any wayi know that but i was so young and i didn’t really know what was happeningi know i’m sorryand i didn’t know how to react, who to trust, what to do…what do you mean who to trust?well, i felt like you guys were creating sides in a sense, like as if i had to pick onei never really felt that wayreally? are you sure? because you used to tell me some stuff about mum which was clearly untrue and then i would side with you for a while. it really fucked with my headlook, i was in a bad place ok? i’m sorryyes i know, i guess i’m just brining this up because we’re having this conversation now but i’m not holding any grudges reallyare you sure?yeah i think so, i mean i can’t really know what’s going on, deep down in my subconscious but i really don’t think i ever see you badly reallyi’m really thankful for thatyeah, well i mean you still piss me off sometimesand you still piss me off sometimes!do you remember when we used to get into those crazy arguments when i was younger?i do, when you were about 16?yeah damn, we really didn’t get along around that timeyeah i guess that’s because you were my first experience with raising a teenager. i have thicker skin with your sister nowno dad, i also think it’s because we have clashing personalitiesoh really, in what way?well, i mean clashing and similar at the same time actually?what your obsessive nature?yeah my obsessive nature, the way i obsess over everything. how everything needs to be my way, or i sort of internally freak out. i know what i want basically. i also feel like i have slight ocd from you honestlyi don’t have ocd?oh man, yes you do. cleaning the floor twice a day and hoovering at 8am? that’s obsessive compulsivei just like keeping the house cleani know you do, and i commend that. it’s taught me to do the same with my place now, but my god it would bother me when i was youngeri knowlike for example the way you’d go nuts if we walked on the floor with our bare feet?yeahi mean it was literally our house, i needed to wear slippers everywherethat floor was special though, it was some kind of weird white resin that got dirty super fastyeah but anyways i don’t think it was just that, i think that a lot of my childhood consisted of just listening to you with my tail between my legs and when i hit sixteen i kind of just wanted to do my own thinglike any sixteen year oldyes i know but i mean that’s why we clashed so much, i just didn’t accept most of what you said or wanted me to do anymorei rememberjust silly stuff, i think i started rebelling against that and just getting angry in general… like those damn vegetables.you never liked your vegetables lucas, come on…i did, i don’t know what that obsession was with you that i didn’twhat?it’s almost as if you felt like you wanted to find something that bothered you about meno not at all, i mean i just wanted the best for your healthyes but i very clearly ate all the vegetables that were on my platewell, what about salad huh?you know that i just never liked salad, it’s that simpleor tomatoes?yes ok fine, or tomatoes, but i felt like you would literally make those things so that i would not eat them and then you could complainoh come on, i was never that pettyfine, but that’s how i felthonestly i was just scared for your health, that’s all.but see! that’s what i mean… i probably ate better than most kids, but you needed me to eat everything otherwise it pissed you off… it’s like the thing with the damn phones!the phones?yeah the phones, you got obsessed with the idea that i was constantly on my phonebut again… you were constantly on your phone weren’t you?no, i mean sure i was on it a decent amountyeah you wereyeah, but look it was the age i thinkit all started with that damn ipod touch that everyone wanted at your ageoh yeah! do you remember how much i wanted that thing?definitely, diego got one first didn’t he?yep, i was so damn jealous…but i got you one for christmas that year!you did, it was such an amazing gift. i remember playing on it for hoursthat’s when you started spending so much time on your devices!yes, but it was a whole new world for me. to be able to download any games was amazing.i never really understood thatunderstood what?the whole gaming thingwhat do you mean?what was so attractive about gaming on a small screen?i don’t know, to be honest i was never allowed a console from you and mum so it was basically my first console.that’s true! you never got that nintendo ds that you wanted so badlyoh man, i never wanted something more in my life… i wanted it more than that tiger toy i ask for christmas when we were on holidayyour mum would have been so angry at me if i would have bought you a nintendo dsi know. i clearly remember looking at them in shops and imagining all the things i could do and how i could try and buy myself onethat’s cute, i remember wanting things like that as a kid toolike what?well there was bicycle that i wanted more than anything when i was a kidthat’s such a pre-naughties present to wantit really is, no one asks for bicycles anymorei mean i would definitely want a new bike nowsure, but when you were a kid all you wanted was mario kart or whatevertrue.anyways, what i was trying to say was that i was obsessed with my phone for a while, because it was so exciting to me when i first got one.i knowyes, but then that interest died off after a year and you kept pestering my every single time i got a textwell yes, because you would literally get a text every single second of the daysee, that’s not true. i would get a text and even if i didn’t look at it you would get annoyed that i got that text for some reasonok, maybe we were a bit overbearing with all that technology stuff.i do remember however the first ipod you and mum got me!really?yes it was this tiny one and it was for my birthday. you told me you had a surprise and we took the bus to this shopping centre where you let me pick one outoh yes, of course - i remember that! you were so damn happyi really was, especially because i was only starting to get into music back then and it was the new cool thing to dowhat have an ipod?yeah, i guess, but like collect music, be an angsty rock kid etci remember that stage, your damn black skinny jeansnot too sure what was going on there in that phase of my life.i remember you saying that you’d never wear anything else than black skinny jeansi truly believed that thoughwell look at you now! no skinny jeans…thank goodness for that huh?but i clearly remember really wanting to be angsty and grunge, when truthfully that just wasn’t meevery kid goes through that, yours wasn’t too baddid you go through that?i’m not too sure, i mean i remember wanting to be like my brother but i’m not too sure if there was a certain ‘group’ i wanted to belong toi’m not sure if i was trying to belong to a certain group, i think my friends did and i just wanted to be like them i guesswhich friends?like pj and max. they were so into their music, they loved playing guitar etcoh yeah, that was about the time where you had asked for a guitar and i got you one but you never played it, not even once?sounds about right…it was such a beautiful electric guitar too. did you ever even take a lesson?i don't think sosuch a shame!i know, i do regret it.you were never too good at the cello thoughthat’s true, but i really hated it, plus i was forced to play it at schooli think you were too young to appreciate itprobably yes. i do also regret not getting into skateboarding reallyno you were good! i rememberthat’s not true, that’s just the father in you talking. i couldn’t do any tricks!we got you some lessons though?yes, but i don’t know, it’s just one of those hundreds of things i thought i would love doing and then ended up getting bored of…you never got bored of your computer though!yes i know… i was a bit of a geeky kid, literally the opposite of youno! i didn’t mean it like that, i’m so proud of you. you always help me with my computer and you’re all self taught!i mean yes, but most people of my generation know how to use a computer correctlyi know, but i’m still proud of youthanks dadoften we'd sit and have nothing to discuss and it's only actually after he's passed away that i then think of those points that i'd like to question him about or perhaps discuss with him. i'm not that good at small talk. well i find that in certain social situations and i think you've observed it particularly when i'm among other nigerians. then i suppose a different part of my character emerges that is actually looking back to a time in my life when --from your school period?yeah and i wouldn't normally talk about things like i suppose experiences…with grandpa is there stuff that you wish you spoke to to him about then?yes quite a lot. at the time i wouldn't really know what to talk about.i was just surprised to hear you say that there was stuff you needed to talk about, you know? because in my opinion it was quite hard to try and get conversation from him.i mean it's interesting that you say that as well that it was it was difficult to get him to... to converse.yeahand if you actually got him on a subject that he enjoyed then he would talk at length on other things he wouldn't talk very much. so whereas your grandmother it's different. she likes to talk and i don't think she'd mindboth of them to be fairyes and she would like to have had the same degree of i suppose interaction from a conversation point of view but then i suppose that's one of the differences between men and women as well.i think it probably didn't help him in the long scheme of things as they're married and as they get closer, grandma became more of the spokesperson of the couple which probably led to a less communicative grandpa, but with grandma as well especially now that she's on her own she's more isolated. we should probably make more of an effort. i mean not that we shouldn't have made more of an effort with grandpa but with grandma being on her own i don't want her to be sort of cut off in in senseand you know sometimes if i don’t raise my voice, i just don't get listened to. and then it turns into usually if i don't raise my voice and then eventually turns into if i never raise my voice i never get heard.most of the time when you don't shout, we hear you but people do choose to ignore you.oh that's even worse. so you listen to me then choose not to do thingsi rarely do that.. maybeso it’s casually ignoring, deliberately ignoring me...what's your favorite part about mum.your mum - she's just great. my best friend and the person i can tell anything to and the person i share a life with.so, you would tell her that you accidentally killed someone if you accidentally killed someone?if i accidentally killed someone, i feel as though i might not tell mummy.you just said you tell her anythingok. yeah. ok.there's always things that you may not want to share like...like what you’re getting her for christmas?oh that is a perfect example. you don't share what you get people christmas. she finds that on christmas day. as i haven’t actually killed someone, that i am aware of, i would not share that with her.why did i even ask you that?.i don't know.have you ever killed someone?no. worst thing i ever did was accidentally throw a rock someone's head in receptionthrew a rock at my sister head and she had a little scar above her eyebrow. whoops. grandma was not happy.what did she do to you?i got told off but never got any more than told off. i was given the “you've dented your sister's head” lookyeah. you must have a similar look from mummy at times.
